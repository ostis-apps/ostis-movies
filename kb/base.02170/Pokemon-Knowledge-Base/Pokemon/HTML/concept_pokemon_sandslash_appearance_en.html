<h2>Appearance</h2>
Sandslash is a large pangolin. Its back hide is large brown spines. He can curl up into a large ball to protect his underbelly, and in this position he can roll and attack with his spikes. Its main weapon is large claws on its front legs, with which it makes cutting blows. Sandslash also uses claws for digging and they can be poisonous. Its thorns and / or claws may break and fall off regularly, but then regrow.

In the Alola region, Sandslash has an ice-blue hide and ice-covered thorns. These thorns stand taller than the regular Sandslash thorns and resemble icicles. This Pokemon uses its skin to disguise itself in the snow, leaving only its thorns exposed. His body emits cold air that sharpens his needles. Its front legs are larger than its normal shape, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, the Alolan Sandslash can move quickly, carving a path through the snow with its claws.
