<h2>Behavior</h2>
Quite a nosy guy. If danger gets in his way, he will immediately fight. He is referred to as a lonely Pokemon due to his tendency to keep himself apart and avoid meeting due to the trauma caused by the death of his mother. Cubone will often cry at night, mourning his mother. When he cries, the skull he wears on his head vibrates and makes a "mournful and mournful sound." The screams are said to be especially terrible on a full moon night. It seems to him that he recognizes his mother at the full moon, and therefore he howls with special sadness.
