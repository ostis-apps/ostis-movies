<h2>Appearance</h2>
The sandshrew has a dense, broad, sandy body, with a cream colored part of the muzzle and belly. Sandshrew can roll into a ball and move in this position. To do this, the entire body of the sandrus, except for the belly, is covered with plates that protect it when rolling and digging the ground. The muzzle is slightly elongated, the tail is short, conical in shape. Four short legs. Ears are pointed, like a cat's, big black eyes. On the front legs there are three small claws, and on the hind legs there are two large ones, they say that they have poison on their claws. Sandshrew's paws are designed for easy digging. Sandshrew can move both on four legs and on two hind legs, when, for example, the front ones are busy while digging the ground or when attacking. The surface of his body is very dry. therefore dew appears on it after a cold night. The peculiarity of the structure of the body allows him to prevent the evaporation of water from the body, so he can live even in the hottest places. There are no differences in appearance between males and females.

In the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to the snowy mountains due to volcanic activity near desert areas. Its body is light blue in color with a creamy belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around the head, and the ears resemble the entrances of a needle. As he adjusted to this cold climate, his body grew larger and heavier, with a shell of ice covering his skin. This steel coating gives it extra protection, but it cannot curl up into a ball like its desert counterpart. Predators like Weevil exploit his soft belly. Alol Sandshrew's claws allow him to move without sliding on the icy surface, but slide over his belly when he needs to move quickly.
