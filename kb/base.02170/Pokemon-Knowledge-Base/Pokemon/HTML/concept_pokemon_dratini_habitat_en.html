<h2>Habitat</h2>
Dratini is originally from the Kanto region. It lives in lakes and rivers. Dratini is extremely rare. Although quite long in length, it is adept at leading a secretive lifestyle and, if necessary, can easily hide unnoticed. Because of this, even in the Kanto, some believe that dratini is just a myth. The only way to find out that a Dratini lives nearby is to find pieces of shed blue skin. Only recently, a small colony of these beautiful Pokemon has been discovered somewhere underwater. They also say that for the first time this Pokemon was seen by a fisherman who caught a dratini while fishing.
