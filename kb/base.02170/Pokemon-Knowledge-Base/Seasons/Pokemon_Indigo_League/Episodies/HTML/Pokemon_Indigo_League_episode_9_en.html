<h1>Ep.9: The School of Hard Knocks</h1>
The path to the city of <sc_element sys_idtf="Vermilion_City">Vermilion</sc_element> continues, while <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> and <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> argue. Misty says that until Ash gives the money to her for the broken bike, she won't take her eyes off him. <sc_element sys_idtf="Brock">Brock</sc_element> invites them to cool down and hurry up, because they are already late for the ship, which departs from the harbor of this city and which Misty really wants to see. Brock decides to cook something to eat, but for this he needs some firewood. It fell to Ash to collect it, but when he and <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Pikachu">Pikschu</sc_element> went to look for him, they saw a fire in the distance. It was very foggy, and Ash did not immediately understand what was happening there. The fire came from candles held by a small group of teenagers. They made one of them answer various <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element>-related questions. But he could not answer all the questions correctly, because the situation was not very comfortable. Moreover, he also ran on a simulator, which, after each wrong answer, was switched to a higher speed.

Then Ash and Pikachu came running to the rescue of this unfortunate guy. It turned out that all the guys are students of PokémonTech - the high school of Pokémon trainers. And the kid they mocked was not as knowledgeable as they were. They say he undermines the prestige of their school. They refused to fight Ash and left, leaving this guy named Joe with them. Misty and Brock come to the rescue and say that there is a bad name about this school. Misty found a brochure for this school, which says that PokemonTech is a boarding high school for the preparation of qualified trainers.

After passing the exams, graduates are guaranteed the right to join the Pokémon League without qualifying badges. The fog clears and the friends see that they are standing right in front of this school. Joe says that, in fact, he knows all the answers to questions, but when they ask them that way, he gets lost and forgets everything. This school is for millionaire children, it is very difficult to study here, and many have to study day and night in order not to fly out of here. It turned out that such a system was invented by one beautiful girl. The mystic is angry and wants to "restore justice" (most likely because of Ash's joke: "And I know a girl who is not only an arrogant, but also ugly!"). Joe shows the travelers a room with simulation computers and says that on these simulators he has already defeated Cerulin's water Pokémon trainers many times. Misty challenges him to a fight and wins with one blow. Joe is surprised that his plant Pokémon have an advantage, but then Miss College (the girl responsible for the flourishing of cruel methods) appears and explains that in addition to the class, the level of the Pokémon must be considered. She reiterates that Joe is a disgrace to the school and turns her back on him. She easily defeats Pokemon Misty. She is challenged by Ash. She pits against Pikachu <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_cubone">Cubone</sc_element> with lightning immunity. At first, Pikachu fails to defeat his rival, but then, with a dexterous blow unfolding the skull on his head, Pikachu wins. Team R then attacks, but the students throw Pokeballs at them. The team members flee. In the end, Joe declares that he is leaving college and starts conquering Pokémon from scratch, while his friends continue on their way to Vermilion.
