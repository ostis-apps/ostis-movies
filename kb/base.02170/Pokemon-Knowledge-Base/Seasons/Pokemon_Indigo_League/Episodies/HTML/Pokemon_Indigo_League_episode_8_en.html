<h1>Ep.8: Road to Pokemon League</h1>
<sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> goes to Vermilion to defeat the stadium leader there. On the way, he meets various coaches and he defeats them, scoring as many as ten victories in a row.

One of the coaches admires <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element>'s strength and tells him about AJ - a strong coach who never lost and even founded his own stadium. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> goes there and discovers that A.J. has already defeated other coaches 98 times in a row. He challenges him to a fight, which he loses. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> does not want to accept defeat and decides to find out the secret of AJ's strength and looks into his tent, where he sees the gym and his hard training Pokémon. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> begins to reproach AJ with cruel treatment of Pokémon and even tries to incite the latter to riot. To which AJ retorts that he is demanding of Pokémon as well as of himself and, once setting the task of becoming the best, he will achieve his goal by all means.

While <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> is arguing with A.J., Team R steals A.J.'s Sandshrew (thinking it is Ash's Pikachu). They try to escape with him, but Sandshrew breaks free and comes back. Team R comes after him and ends up challenging AJ, who loses. So A.J. wins the 100th victory and goes to get the badges, hoping to meet <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash</sc_element> again.
