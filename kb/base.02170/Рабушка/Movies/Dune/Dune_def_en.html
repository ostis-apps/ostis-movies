The heir of the famous house of Atreides, Paul, goes with his family to one of the most dangerous planets in the universe — Arrakis. There is nothing here but sand, scorching sun, giant monsters and the main cause of intergalactic conflicts — an incredibly valuable resource called melange. As a result of the seizure of power, Paul is forced to flee and hide, and this becomes the beginning of his epic journey. The hostile world of Arrakis has prepared many hard trials for him, but only those who are ready to face their fear are worthy of becoming the chosen one.
