England, the beginning of the XV century, the height of the Hundred Years' War. Prince Hel of Wales leads a dissolute lifestyle with his friend Falstaff and does not think about claiming the throne. But when his father, King Henry IV, dies of an illness, and his younger brother dies on the battlefield, Helu has to accept the crown. Having become Henry V, the young ruler deftly deals with conspiracies and uprisings, and also decides that the French monarchs do not show him due respect.
