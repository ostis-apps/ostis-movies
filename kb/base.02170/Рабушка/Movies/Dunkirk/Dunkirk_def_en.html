The film tells the story of the miraculous rescue of more than three hundred thousand soldiers during the Dunkirk operation that took place at the beginning of World War II. The events begin with the encirclement of hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops by enemy forces. Trapped on the beach, with their backs to the sea, they face an unsolvable situation, while the enemy's grip tightens more and more.
