<h2>Characteristic</h2>
A player does not acquire ownership of a captured Pokémon until they have completed a Catching Show and have decided to place the captured Pokémon in their Storage System. Migrated Pokémon remain in the Poké Balls they were kept in in the Generation III games; no Pokémon can have a Parkball as their own.
