<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_echo">An echo</b></sc_element> is one or more delayed signals that are added to the original. For the effect to be perceived as an echo, the delay must be of the order of 50 ms or more. The effect can be achieved using both analog and digital processing. If a significant number of delayed signals are played for several seconds, the resulting signal creates the effect of being in a large room and is perceived as a reverb effect.
