<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_noise">Noise effects</b></sc_element> are artificial noise effects used in the dubbing of cinematographic and television products, sports broadcasts, computer games. They consist in the selection, imitation and superimposition of various background and synchronous noises on the image, which allows you to animate and give realism to what is happening. They relate to the recording and reproduction of everyday, natural sounds, which can be very diverse (rustling, rustling clothes, footsteps, creaking doors, breaking glass, etc.). Noise effects are also used to hide unnecessary or unwanted loud sounds recorded on the set: the hum of the crowd, transport, sounds of the city. Noise effects add realism and depth to the sound track, as well as simplify the synchronization of sounds.
