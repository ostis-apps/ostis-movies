<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_flanger">Flanger</b></sc_element> - the delayed signal is added to the original with a variable delay of up to 10 ms. This effect is achieved by digital processing, although it is achieved by playing the same recording of the recording on two synchronized players and then mixing. To achieve the effect, the operator places his finger on the edge (English flange) of one of the disks, somewhat slowing down its movement, and hence its sound. When the operator removes his finger, the mechanism speeds up the movement of the disc, synchronizing it with the other.
