<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_magneto_optical_sound_recording">Magneto-optical sound recording</b></sc_element> is one of the types of <b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_digital_sound_recording">digital sound recording</b></sc_element>, in which recording to a magneto-optical disc is carried out using the following technology: laser radiation heats up a section of the track above the Curie point temperature, after which electromagnetic the pulse changes the magnetization, creating prints equivalent to pits on optical disks.
