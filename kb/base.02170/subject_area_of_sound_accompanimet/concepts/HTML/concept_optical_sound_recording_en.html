<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_optical_sound_recording">Optical sound recording</b></sc_element> â€” recording of sound vibrations by a corresponding change in the optical density or reflectivity of the carrier. In most cases, the concept of optical sound recording is used in relation to the recording of sound by a photographic method, which has become widespread thanks to sound cinematography. In this case, the sound is recorded using light on a moving photosensitive film that changes its optical density after laboratory processing. This technology in cinematography is sometimes called photographic sound recording or tonfilm. The use of a common medium for recording sound and images eliminates the problems of their synchronization during the demonstration of the film.
