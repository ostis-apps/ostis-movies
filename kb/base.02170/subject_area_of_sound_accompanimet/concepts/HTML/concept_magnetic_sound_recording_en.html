<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_magnetic_sound_recording">Magnetic sound recording</b></sc_element> is based on the use of the properties of some materials to retain magnetization after the external magnetic field ceases to affect them.
The recording is performed using a special device â€” a recording magnetic head that creates an alternating magnetic field on a section of a moving medium (most often a magnetic tape) that has magnetic properties. A trace of residual magnetization remains on the ferromagnetic layer of the carrier. The trace is the track of the phonogram. During playback, the magnetic head converts the residual magnetic flux of the moving recording medium into an electrical audio signal.
