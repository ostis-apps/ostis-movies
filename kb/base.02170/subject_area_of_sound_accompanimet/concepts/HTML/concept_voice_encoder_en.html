<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_voice_encoder">Vocoder</b></sc_element> is a speech synthesis device based on an arbitrary signal with a rich spectrum. Initially, vocoders were developed in order to save the frequency resources of the radio line of the communication system when transmitting speech messages. Savings are achieved due to the fact that instead of the actual speech signal, only the values of its specific parameters are transmitted, which control the speech synthesizer on the receiving side.
