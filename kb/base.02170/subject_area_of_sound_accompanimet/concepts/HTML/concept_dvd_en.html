<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_dvd">DVD</b></sc_element> is an optical data carrier made in the form of a disk for storing various information in digital form. It has the same size as the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_cd">CD</b></sc_element>, but a denser structure of the working surface, which allows it to have a larger amount of stored information due to the use of a laser with a shorter wavelength and a lens with a larger numerical aperture.
