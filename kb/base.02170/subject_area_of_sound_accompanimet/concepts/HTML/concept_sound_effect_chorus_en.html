<b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_chorus">Chorus</b></sc_element>   - the delayed signal is added to the original with a constant delay. The delay should be short to avoid the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_echo">echo effect</b></sc_element>, but more than 5 ms, otherwise the wave interference will lead to the  <b><sc_element sys_idtf="concept_sound_effect_flanger">flanging effect</b></sc_element>. Often, delayed signals are pitch-shifted slightly to achieve a more realistic ensemble effect.
