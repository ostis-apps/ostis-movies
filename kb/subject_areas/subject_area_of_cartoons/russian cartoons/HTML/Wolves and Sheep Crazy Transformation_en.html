<h1>Wolves and Sheep: Crazy Transformation</h1>
The favorite of the pack, the young and carefree wolf Gray doesnâ€™t know that he will soon be a stranger among his friends. Claiming the role of the leader of the pack and the hand (or rather, the paw) and the heart of the most beautiful wolf Bianchi, Gray continues to fool around and arrange pranks over her relatives. Everything turns upside down when he decides to change himself with a magic potion. A miracle really happens: Gray turns into a ram! Fearing for his own, now sheep, skin, Gray escapes from the wolves and settles in the village of sheep.

Now Gray is to not only regain the trust of his beloved and the flock, but also his former appearance. But how to do it, if you have only three days, and even horns and hooves?
