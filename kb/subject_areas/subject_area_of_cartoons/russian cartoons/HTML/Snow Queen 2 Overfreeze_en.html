<h1>Snow Queen 2: Overfreeze</h1>
The vain troll Orme has long dreamed of the hero's laurels, and finally gets this chance: the north wind threatens the world with eternal winter and abducts Maribel. The hand of the princess and the kingdom of trolls will go to the one who will free her from the snow captivity. Once Orm won the winter with the help of friends, now he wants to go it alone. On it is armor from pans, behind it is a squad of cowardly trolls, and in front is a dangerous path to the castle of the Snow Queen. But, fortunately, friends do not remember the offenses: the brave Gerd, the shy Kai, the away Alfida and the merry Lutha will not abandon Orme in trouble. So they are waiting for an incredible adventure!
