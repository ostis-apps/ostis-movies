<h1>Cartoon remake</h1>
The term is used in relation to cartoons, which are based on the original cartoons created earlier. That is, a cartoon remake is a film based on another cartoon. Usually, remake directors rework the original cartoon in their own way, but sometimes new versions are made that completely repeat the original.
