<h1>Sawa. Warrior heart</h1>
The story of a boy Sawa ten years old, who lives in a small forest village. Once upon a time, noble white wolves defended the village from their enemies. But one day the wolves disappeared and a gang of fierce Hyenas attacked the village. Savva manages to escape to the forest, where he meets Anga - the last white wolf.

Anga tells Sawa about a powerful Wizard who lives on a mountain and can help Sawa free his village. But, unfortunately, this mountain is surrounded by a huge army, led by the evil Mama Jozi, the three-headed monkey queen.

Dealing with insurmountable difficulties, Sawa and Anga begin their long and dangerous journey to the mountain. On the way, other travelers join them: Pusik - a strange pink fluffy creature; Fafl is a self-confident type, similar to a Frenchman, who in reality is an enchanted semi-baron and forced to carry mosquitoes on the Kingâ€™s shoulder; the princess of the swamp tribe of Nanti and others. Everyone has their own personal reasons for going to the Wizard. On the way to their goal, friends have to overcome many obstacles, learn terrible secrets and join the battle with the army of monkeys and treacherous Mom Jozi.
