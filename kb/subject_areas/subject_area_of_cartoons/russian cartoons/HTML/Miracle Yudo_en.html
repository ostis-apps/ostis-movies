<h1>Miracle Yudo</h1>
In a certain kingdom, in a certain state, there lived King Eremey with three sons. He was busy all day with the most important affairs of state - dictating his memoirs about his non-existent deeds. Then one day, in broad daylight, the monster of the dragon breed was found on the border of the Kingdom, or more simply, the Miracle Yudo. And the King sent the monster's sons to conquer and multiply the glory of the royal race. But while the elder sons were sleeping, and Ivan was fighting with Miracle Yud, it turned out that Princess Barbara from the Neighboring Kingdom had disappeared. And Ivan went in search of her. Well, Wonder Yudo grabbed it along. Just in case. Suddenly, the road will come in handy! Only Ivan did not know that this Dragon is not the one for whom he claims to be.</body>
