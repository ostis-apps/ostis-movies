<h1>Koo! Kin-Dza-Dza</h1>
Beginner DJ Tolik and world-renowned cellist Vladimir Chizhov meet a barefoot man in a noisy Moscow street. Clicking on the button of a strange car, the heroes move to the desert planet Plyuk. An animated remake of the beloved movie “Kin-dza-dza!” Is no less exciting and funny than the original, tells about the adventures of Tolik and Uncle Vova. In this world of sand, people are divided into two categories - patsakov and chatlan, a simple match has an incredible value, and people are met and escorted by the color of their pants.
