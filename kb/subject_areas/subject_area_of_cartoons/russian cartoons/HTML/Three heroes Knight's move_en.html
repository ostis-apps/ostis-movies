<h1>Three heroes: Knight's move</h1>
The court horse Guy Julius Caesar to his misfortune overhears the conversation of the boyars and learns about the plot against the prince. What to do? There is no one to protect the prince! The warriors are far away - they catch the robber Potan, Gorynych on vacation, the army at the exercises ... But if the bad guys are going to take over the world, then someone needs to save him? Who is he, a real hero, who will come to the rescue? Of course, the horse Julius! This strategist and the "great combinator". He will certainly save everyone, and if he does not, then at least he will try. The main thing is that the operation to save the world does not turn into a complete disaster.
