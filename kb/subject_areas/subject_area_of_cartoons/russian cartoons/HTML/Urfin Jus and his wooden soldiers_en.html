<h1>Urfin Jus and his wooden soldiers</h1>
The treacherous and evil Urfin Joes decided to become the ruler of the Magic Country, to capture the Emerald City with the help of his blockhead soldiers and rename it to Urfinhrad. He is already preparing to celebrate the victory, but the most ordinary girl Ellie intervenes in the matter, and she finds herself in the Magic Country at the most appropriate time. She really needs to go back home, but first she needs to help her friends Strashila, the Woodcutter and Lev defeat Urfin and his army.
