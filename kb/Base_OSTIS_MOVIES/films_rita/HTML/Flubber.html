<h1>Flubber</h1>

Flabber. The last invention of the Professor of chemistry, on which he worked all his life. The absent-minded scientist does not even suspect what an important discovery he has given to the world. After all, in fact, this unremarkable piece of rubber-a concentrated clot of energy of incredible power. Put on Slippers made of magic material, and you can safely go to the competition in high jump. If this is not enough for you - fill your car with it, but it is better not to press the gas, otherwise soon the radars will detect an unidentified flying object in the air. And now imagine what could happen if unmanageable matter disappears right from under the nose of a happy Professor and falls into the hands of villains...
