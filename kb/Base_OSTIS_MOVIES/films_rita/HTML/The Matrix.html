<h1>The Matrix</h1>

Thomas Anderson's life is divided into two parts: during the day he is the most ordinary office worker, receiving scolding from his superiors, and at night he turns into a hacker named Neo, and there is no place in the network where he could not reach. But one day everything changes â€” the hero, unwittingly, learns the terrible truth: everything that surrounds him is nothing more than an illusion, a Matrix, and people are just a source of power for the artificial intelligence that enslaved humanity. And only Neo is able to change the balance of forces in this strange and terrible world.
