<h1>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</h1>

In a new story about the search for truth, betrayal, eternal youth and mortal danger, captain Jack Sparrow will face a woman from his past Angelica. Until the very end, it will not be clear whether their true love binds, or Angelica skillfully pretends to get together with Jack to the mysterious source of eternal youth. She forces captain Jack Sparrow to Board the ship Queen Anne's Revenge, which is controlled by the insidious villain Blackbeard. Our hero finds himself in a situation where he does not know what to fear more â€“ a terrible villain or his old girlfriend.
