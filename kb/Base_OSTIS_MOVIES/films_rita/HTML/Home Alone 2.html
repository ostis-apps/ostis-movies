<h1>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</h1>

America's smallest hero is causing a big stir in new York! Kevin McCallister is back! But now he's not home alone, he's in new York, and he has enough money and credit cards to turn the Big Apple into his own Playground. But, as always, Kevin is not destined to be alone for long: his old friends-crooks Harry and Marv-escaped from prison, where they were the efforts of Kevin. And they had to get to the city where Kevin planned to have fun! New traps and traps are waiting for would-be bandits.
