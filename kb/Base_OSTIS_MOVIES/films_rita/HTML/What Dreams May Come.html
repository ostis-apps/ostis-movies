<h1>What Dreams May Come</h1>

After the death of Chris Nilsen in a car accident, he, having gained immortality, tries to stay close to his beautiful but mortal wife Annie. With the help of a friendly spirit assigned to him as a guide, he begins to get used to his new existence in an environment that can only be called Paradise. But when his distraught wife commits suicide, she is cursed and banished to hell forever. Chris struggles to find his beloved, to always be with her, but no one has ever managed to save a sinful soul from a terrible but deserved retribution. Thanks to the help of his heavenly friends, Chris embarks on the most dangerous and painful journey of his life, or rather, in the life after death.
