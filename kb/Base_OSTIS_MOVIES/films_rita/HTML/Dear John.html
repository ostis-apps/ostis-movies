<h1>Dear John</h1>

Young Savannah and American army soldier John tenderly love each other, expressing their feelings in letters that for John are the only source of joy and hope in the ongoing war. For John, there is a concept of "duty" that forces him to stay in the army after the events of September 11, preventing him from fulfilling his promise to return and marry a girl. This decision distances them from each other and letters from Savannah come less and less often.
