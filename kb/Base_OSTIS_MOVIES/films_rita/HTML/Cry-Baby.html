<h1>Cry-Baby</h1>

Wade Walker, nicknamed "cry-baby" is the most daring and brazen bully at school. His ability to shed a single tear drives all the girls crazy, especially the beautiful Allison. When this right girl falls in love with a crybaby, their love happiness is hampered by both her strict grandmother and the annoying clingers who are in love with them to the point of unconsciousness, as well as the fact that Allison belongs to the "enemy" clan of the rich and conservatives, and her company is at war with the Crybaby gang.
