<h1>Fight Club</h1>

An insurance company employee suffers from chronic insomnia and is desperate to escape from an excruciatingly boring life. Once in another business trip, he meets a certain Tyler Durden-a charismatic soap merchant with a perverted philosophy. Tyler believes that self-improvement is for the weak, and the only thing worth living for is self â€” destruction. A little time passes, and now new friends are beating each other for nothing in the Parking lot in front of the bar, and the cleansing fight gives them the highest bliss. Introducing other men to the simple pleasures of physical cruelty, they found a secret Fight club, which begins to enjoy incredible popularity.
