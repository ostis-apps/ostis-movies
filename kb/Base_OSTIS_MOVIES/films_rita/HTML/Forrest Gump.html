<h1>Forrest Gump</h1>

On behalf of the main character Forrest Gump, a feeble-minded harmless man with a noble and open heart, the story of his extraordinary life is told. Fantastically, he turns into a famous football player, a war hero, a successful businessman. He becomes a billionaire, but remains as guileless, stupid and kind. Forrest expects constant success in everything, and he loves the girl with whom he was friends as a child, but reciprocity comes too late.
