<h1>Pretty Woman</h1>

Financial magnate Edward Lewis, driving through the city at night, stops near a beautiful woman. Her name is Vivien and she only takes cash. The next morning, he realizes that he does not want to leave her and offers the girl to stay in his hotel room for some time - for an additional fee. Vivien finds herself in a sea of glitter and lies. She endures neglect for the sake of the man she likes, who has ceased to be just a client for her.
