<h1>Jurassic Park</h1>

An expansive rich man and Professor persuades two paleontologists to come to an island off the coast of Costa Rica, where he arranged a Jurassic Park. The Park is inhabited by long-extinct dinosaurs, recreated by the Professor on blood samples from a fossil mosquito, which should be the highlight of the new attraction. With days to go until the opening, a member of staff tries to steal priceless embryos, disrupts the security system, which together with a thunderstorm leads to a power outage and protective barriers. Just as the paleontologists and the Professor's grandchildren were on a trial tour.
