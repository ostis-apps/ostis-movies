<h1>Titanic</h1>

In the first and last voyage of the chic Titanic, two meet. The lower deck passenger Jack won a ticket at cards, and the heiress rose goes to America to marry for convenience. The feelings of young people only have time to blossom, and not even class differences will create a test for lovers, but an iceberg that stood in the way of a ship that was considered unsinkable.
