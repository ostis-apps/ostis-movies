<h1>Jumanji</h1>

Four teenagers find themselves inside the Jumanji game. They will fight with a rhinoceros, black Mambo, and every step will be watched by an endless 
series of traps and puzzles. To complete the game and stay alive, they will have to reincarnate in the characters of the game: timid and shy Spencer 
turns into a brave and strong researcher, big Fridge — in Shorty, fashionista and beauty bettani — a Professor, and clumsy and awkward Martha becomes 
fearless and agile Amazon. Friends will have to get used to a completely new and so unusual for themselves roles and find their way home.
