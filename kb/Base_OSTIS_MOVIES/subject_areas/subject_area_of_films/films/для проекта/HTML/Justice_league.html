<h1>Justice league</h1>

Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne returns. He enlists the 
support of a new ally, Diana Prince, to fight an even more powerful enemy. Batman and Wonder Woman quickly recruit a team 
of superhumans to fight the awakened threat. But despite the unique composition of the superhero squad-Batman, Wonder Woman, 
Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash-perhaps to save the planet from an invasion of catastrophic proportions is too late.
