<h1>Bel Canto</h1>
Opera singer Roxana Koss resides in one of the cities of South America to hold a concert for a wealthy Japanese industrialist. The audience and guests of the concert program were filled with emotions from the performance of the diva. Her wonderful voice inspired and agitated, causing a flurry of positive emotions in the crowd. But none of those present could have imagined that a wonderful creative evening would turn into torture, a struggle for survival. When armed people led by General Benjamin burst into the hall building - the guests of the evening held their breath in fear. And then the marginals began to dictate their conditions. They demanded that political prisoners be released, and in exchange they would leave the hostages alive, the number of which prevails over the figure of 490. However, after hearing the terrible demand of the terrorists, the authorities are in no hurry to fulfill their conditions. On the contrary, they pull time, enter into meaningless negotiations and more and more force an already tense situation.
