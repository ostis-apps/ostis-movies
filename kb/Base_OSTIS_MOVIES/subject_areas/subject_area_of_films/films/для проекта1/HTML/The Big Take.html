<h1>The Big Take</h1>
In the center of events is the novice screenwriter Max O'Leary and the famous actor Douglas Brown. Max has always dreamed of becoming famous as a director of a cult film. Therefore, once he began writing a script for a future film, which will surely become a box office and glorify him as a genius scriptwriter and director. Max did his best to make the plot plot worthy of a film adaptation. His close friend Vick learned about the completion of the script. And he also realized that Max simply does not have money for shooting the film, and the sponsors will not invest in the dubious production of the film. Then he filmed a covert video of the famous actor Douglas Brown on a covert surveillance camera in order to extract 200 thousand dollars from him with blackmail. True, Brown instructed his agent to deal with all this. And he hired for this purpose a private detective who quickly went to Max. Is a big jackpot broken?
