<h1>Galveston</h1>
Roy Cady - the minion of the mafia. Out of casual recklessness, he crossed the road to his boss, a bloodthirsty, influential authority. Given the circumstances, he does not intend to forgive Roy an unacceptable mistake and, as a punishment, sends him to another task. However, having arrived at the destination in order to fulfill the will of the boss, Roy finds himself in the trap. Quickly orienting in unforeseen circumstances, the hero immediately tries to escape from the executioners. Roy miraculously survived by shooting all the mercenaries. And as soon as he had the opportunity to carry away his legs from the field of organized “purgatory,” a girl named Rocky caught up in the eyes of the hero was captured by the bandits. He frees the hostage and reluctantly takes her with him. Both embark on a run. And Galveston becomes the first city on their way, where they plan to sit out for a while. However, Rocky is determined to make adjustments to Roy’s plans.
