<h1>The Package</h1>
At the epicenter of the comedy film are five high school students. All of them think of themselves as adults, self-sufficient personalities who can drink alcohol and take off as they please. Because they go to relax in the lap of nature, after having bought a lot of beer. The guys got to the goal, settled down, and as usual, decided to drink a can of beer and get some fresh air away from the polluted city smog. It all started rosy, and heart-to-heart talkers even began to bring the heroes closer together. But among the crowd, Jeremy was always considered to be the joker. So this time the guy took on his chest and decided to show a master class on the possession of a folding knife. In the process of improvised tricks, he cuts off ... his causal place. Friends are shocked by what happened. Operatively, they called an ambulance, which surprisingly arrived very quickly. All the guys are worried about Jeremy ... when suddenly the victim remembers that his "device" was left at the resting place. Heroes need to manage in 12 hours to find the very "place" of a friend ...
