The rescue shuttle, in which the hero is located, moves towards the sun. Death is about to overtake Holloway. There is no one who could help Troy. However, he is not looking for her. But there is a weak radio signal. The command does not want to lose courageous sensible officer Through the use of intermittent extremely weak communications, the commander Roberts gives instructions to the hero sharpened in the shuttle. Troy is still not aware that the road to hell changes course towards survival. Is he ready to fight for his life in the name of the memory of his late son, in the name of himself? Can the commander find the right words to reach out to Troy's mind?
