The film is based on real events in the life of the legendary diver Karl Brashear. His mentor and senior officer, Bill Sunday, is convinced that blacks have nothing to do in the navy, and in the most cruel and inhuman ways he mocks and “breaks off” an ambitious newcomer.
However, he fails to do this, and moreover, he soon begins to feel sympathy for this extremely hard-nosed guy, who will die rather than show weakness. Together, they are trying to resist the bureaucrats from the command of the Navy, who are not satisfied with the skin color of the hero.
Karl is always volunteered to perform the most dangerous secret special operations associated with an increased risk to life. However, fate prepared him a much more terrible ordeal, which only a real hero can overcome.
