Malena is a beautiful widow, the obsession of men and the envy of women. Wives spread dirty gossip about her. Husbands stalk her and dream about her.

â€œI was 13 when I saw her for the first time. Time passed, I loved many women, and when we were close, they asked: would I remember them? And I said: yes, I will remember you. But the only one I will never forget is the one that never asked. Malena.
