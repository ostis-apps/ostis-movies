<h1>Planes</h1>
Dusty Poleipole is a modest hard worker-plane working as an agricultural sprayer at a provincial provincial airfield. However, this does not prevent him from dreaming of taking part in the round-the-world races of the fastest aircraft one day. One bad luck - Dusty is panicky afraid of high heights. Therefore, when, by chance, he still falls into the number of participants in the qualifying round of air competitions, he has to seek help from a veteran of the naval aviation, a retired fighter Skipper. With the help of a wise mentor, Dusty will be able to overcome his weaknesses and challenge the arrogant champion Ripslinger, and the whole world will follow the race in heaven with bated breath!</body>
