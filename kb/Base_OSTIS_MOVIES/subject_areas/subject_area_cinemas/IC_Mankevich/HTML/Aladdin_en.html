<h1>Aladdin</h1>
In the glorious city of Agrab lives Aladdin, a cheerful thief with a golden heart. He lives and does not know that soon he will have the greatest adventure in life. After all, only with its help the black magician Jafar can take possession of an incredible treasure - a lamp in which a powerful genie fulfilling desires is enclosed. And only the cunning, ingenuity and kindness of Aladdin and his friends - monkey Abu, Princess Jasmine and Jinn himself - can prevent Jafar from taking over the lamp and seizing power over the world.
