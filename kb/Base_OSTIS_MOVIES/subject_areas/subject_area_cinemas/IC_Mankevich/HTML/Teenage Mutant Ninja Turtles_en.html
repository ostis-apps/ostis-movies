<h1>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</h1>
Once an immigrant from Japan, Hamato Yoshi bought a pet - four turtles. But under the influence of the mutagen, Yoshi turned into a half-rat, half-human Splinter, and the turtles grew to enormous size and acquired human features and qualities. Under the ground, in the pipes of the collector, Splinter raised them as his own sons, having taught discipline, philosophy and martial arts - all that will help to survive. And now, fifteen years later, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are ready to challenge the streets of New York, hostile and full of dangers! Opponents can be far more menacing than they seem, and pizza is even tastier than you can imagine ... make sure of this along with the turtles Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo!
