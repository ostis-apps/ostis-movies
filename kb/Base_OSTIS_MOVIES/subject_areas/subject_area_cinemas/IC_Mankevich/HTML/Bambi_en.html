<h1>Bambi</h1>
One morning a deer was born in a small forest meadow lit by the spring sun. All the animals and birds ran to the new forest prince and flocked to see. The fawn was named Bambi. When Bambi learned to walk and talk, he made friends - a rabbit Tampere and a skunk Flower. And once in the meadow, where his mother brought, Bambi met a little funny deer - Feilin. But life in the forest can be dangerous and cruel. For the first time, Bambi came across this when shotgun shots pierced the clear autumn forest air - all the animals began to flee in panic, and then Bambi first heard the terrible word - Man.
