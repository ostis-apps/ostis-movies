<h1>Balto</h1>
In the glorious city of Agrab lives Aladdin, a cheerful thief with a golden heart. He lives and does not know that soon he will have the greatest adventure in life. After all, only with its help the black magician Jafar can take possession of an incredible treasure - a lamp in which a powerful genie fulfilling desires is enclosed. And only the cunning, ingenuity and kindness of Aladdin and his friends - monkey Abu, Princess Jasmine and Jinn himself - are able to prevent Jafar from taking over the lamp and take power over the world. Half like, half wolf, Balto himself does not know who he really is. A chased tramp in the icy desert of Alaska. Only his friends, the Russian polar goose Boris, the teddy bears Mack and Luck and the beautiful like Jenna are sure that although he is not like everyone else, a noble heart beats in his chest. One day misfortune happens. The diphtheria epidemic has gripped the children of a small village, and the ferocious blizzard has made all roads impassable. Only a dog team can overcome six hundred miles through a blinding Arctic storm and bring life-saving medicine. But the dogs lost their way somewhere in the frozen expanses. Now only Balto can find a team and save the children, and at the same time become a hero and a true legend!
