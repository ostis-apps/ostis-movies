<h1>Gravity Falls</h1>
Gravity Falls - a town located in Oregon. It was here that the glorious kids came - Dipper and Mabel's twin sister. The children arrived on vacation to stay with their cousin Grandfather named Stan, who owns perhaps the main attraction of a boring settlement - a tourist center with the alluring name "Cabin of Miracles."
