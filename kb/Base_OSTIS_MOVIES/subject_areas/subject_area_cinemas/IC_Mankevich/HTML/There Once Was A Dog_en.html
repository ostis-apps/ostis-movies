<h1>There once was a dog</h1>
The action takes place on a Ukrainian farm. The elderly watchdog Dog is no longer needed by anyone, and the owners decide to drive him out of the yard. The last straw that overflowed their patience was that the Dog did not raise an alarm during the theft that happened at night in the dogâ€™s house. To the aid of the Dog, who escaped into the forest after he was kicked out of the house, and who was ready to take his own life, his former foe Wolf came. He helps Dog to demonstrate his need to the previous owners: he cleverly stage the abduction of the master's baby, and Dog pretends that he defeats the Wolf and saves the baby. In return, the Dog is returned with honors to the farm.
