<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Maleficent"> Maleficent </ sc_element> </ b> - a powerful dark fairy and the embodiment of absolute evil,
responsible for all the misadventures in the kingdom of king Stephen.
It is the <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Maleficent"> Maleficent </ sc_element> </ b> that puts the deadly spell
at <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Princess_Aurora"> Princess Aurora </ sc_element> </ b>, thereby wanting to get even with her parents,
who did not invite the proud witch to the christening of her daughter.
She is also the exact opposite and sworn enemy of the three good fairies - <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Flora"> Flora </ sc_element> </ b>,
<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Fauna"> Fauna </ sc_element> </ b> and
<b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Marieveza"> Marywezes </ sc_element> </ b>
who always do everything in their power to resist the power of the sorceress and interfere with her prudent and sinister plans.
