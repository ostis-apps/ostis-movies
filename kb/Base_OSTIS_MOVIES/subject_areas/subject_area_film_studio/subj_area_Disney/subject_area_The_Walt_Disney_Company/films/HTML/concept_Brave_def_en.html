<h1> Brave </h1>

Amazingly beautiful and instructive cartoon "Brave at Heart" from Pixar, which has already managed to gather an army of fans, can now be viewed online at our Internet cinema. This is an amazing story about a capricious red-haired girl who broke the hearts of three princes at once, almost started a civil war, turned her mother into a bear, and indeed did things, but in the end managed to correct her mistakes and restore harmony in the world. Since childhood, Merida had a restless temper.
Instead of sitting in the castle, embroidering a cross and waiting for the beloved and only on a white horse, as befits princesses, she ran, jumped and shot from a bow better than any boy. But the years went by, the girl grew up and once it was time to think about marriage. Three lords laid claim to the hand and heart of the red-haired beauty at once. But, valuing personal freedom, an enterprising princess still invented a way to outwit the suitors: she invited them to compete in archery and, of course, won, keeping her arm and heart with her. Mother Merinda Elinor did not like this idea.
A major scandal broke out in the royal family, as a result of which the self-confident girl ran away from home. Well, what it led to, you can learn from the cartoon.
