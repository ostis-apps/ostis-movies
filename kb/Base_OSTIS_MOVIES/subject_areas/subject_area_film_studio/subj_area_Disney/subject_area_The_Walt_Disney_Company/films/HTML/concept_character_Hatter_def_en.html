    <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Hatter"> The Hatter </ sc_element> </ b> is a hat-maker, one of the participants of the Mad Tea Party.
When meeting with <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Alice"> Alice </ sc_element> </ b>, it behaves tactlessly,
therefore, the main character asks him "not to become personal." She gives riddles to her and periodically tries to wake Mouse-Sonia.
By the expression <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Cheshire_Cat"> Chesyr cat </ sc_element> </ b>, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Hatter"> Mad Hatter </ sc_element> </ b>

At trial, he acted as the first witness, describing himself as a “little man,” who is as round as his hats.
The character did not figure in the original version of the tale.
His name and character presumably originated from the saying "Madness as a Hatter".
That, in turn, was based on the fact that hats could really go crazy with the mercury vapor used to process the felt.
However, Dr. med. H. Waldron refutes this theory, stating that mercury poisoning can cause mental disorder,
associated with excessive timidity, anxiety and unobtrusiveness, which does not correspond to the image of an eccentric and extravagant <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Hatter"> Mad Hatter </ sc_element> </ b>
