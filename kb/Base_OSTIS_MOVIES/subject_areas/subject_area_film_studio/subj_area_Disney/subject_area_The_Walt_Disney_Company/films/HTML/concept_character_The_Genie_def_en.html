    <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_The_Genie"> Genie </ sc_element> </ b> is a magical creature, a spirit lamp. In the past, like an ordinary genie, he was a prisoner of a lamp.
Finding a new owner, he was obliged to fulfill three of any desires, with the exception of murder, the resurrection from the dead and the spell of love.
Being released by <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Aladine </ sc_element> </ b>, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_The_Genie"> Genn </ sc_element> </ b> becomes his true friend. After liberation, the genie’s magical abilities declined with “phenomenal and
cosmic ”to“ semi-phenomenal and almost cosmic ”, remaining, in any case, more than impressive. He is able to create and move objects
clone, transform yourself and turn people and animals into any creatures, sometimes teleport, but not from a closed space
(for example, a vessel with a cork, which is often caught), resize from the tiny to the gigantic, physically strong enough, can fly.
By nature, he is kind, almost always cheerful, he likes to encourage his friends with jokes. Allergic to guava juice, from which it suffers in a very peculiar way.
Often competes with the Carpet in various games and all the time loses to him. In love with Eden.
