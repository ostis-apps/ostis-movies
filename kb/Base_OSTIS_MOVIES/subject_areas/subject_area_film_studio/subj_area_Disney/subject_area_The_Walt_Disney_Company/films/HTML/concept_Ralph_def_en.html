<h1> Ralph </h1>

Funny and witty cartoon of Rich Moore about how to enter a video game villain if he wants to turn into a positive character. In the cartoon, all the most famous and favorite games of children and adults are used or mentioned, so it is perfect for family viewing. Thug Ralph for thirty years doing the same job in the gaming machine. He demolishes the building of peaceful tenants, while the Felix master of all trades repairs the same house.
Tired of the constant injustice, the fact that Felix receives recognition and medals, and he only falls face in the dirt, Ralph decides to change his fate. At a meeting of anonymous villains, he reports that he is going to change the game and become a hero. However, other villains from video games dissuade him, and they say that his essence will never change and you need to put up with it. Despite this, Ralph decides to re-educate himself by all means.
