    <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b> a little monkey, a faithful friend <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Aladdin </ sc_element> </ b>.
They met when <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b> tried to rob a young man during a street circus performance
- Minos, Fatima and Aziz. To some extent, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b> was a prisoner of the troupe,
as he brought the main income from performances: the monkey robbed gape spectators during the performance.
After a little adventure, as a result of which the trinity was imprisoned in
The fate of fate, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b> decides to stay with <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Aladin </ sc_element> </ b>.
Thanks to him, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Aladdin </ sc_element> </ b> turned out to be a magic lamp,
which <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b> stole a second before they are with <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Aladin </ sc_element> </ b> fell from the threshold of the collapsing Cave of Miracles.
He tries to hide from the dangers, however, sometimes he shows courage and heroism. Although Abu with <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Aladdin"> Alladin </ sc_element> </ b> no longer needs to steal, yet, <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Abu"> Abu </ sc_element> </ b>
sometimes it pulls on thieves' leprosy, which is often pushed by <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "character_Iago"> Iago </ sc_element> </ b>. He likes to eat deliciously. Being a monkey, yet Abu is reasonable, unlike ordinary monkeys able to speak. Abu's speech is difficult to picky, similar to screams. Only Iago can disassemble it, which translates it into understandable language.
