<h1> Lady and the Tramp </h1>
The touching and exciting story of the rapprochement of two completely different dogs - a pedigree sissy and an ordinary mongrel. Elegant and fluffy as a toy, the cocker Spanielsha Lady was the favorite of the owners, until a baby appeared in their family. The muzzle put on was the last straw that pushed the offended heroine to escape. But on the street, a whole bunch of dangers awaited her, about the existence of which she did not even suspect. And then a vagabond dog came to the aid of a miniature black-eyed beauty, the nobility of which was not in the breed, but in the soul.
