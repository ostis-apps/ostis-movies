Space Ranger buzz Lightyear, cowboy woody, dog Spiral, Tyrannosaurus Rex and the entire toy team are back together, and they are more ready for adventure than ever. Since Andy went to College, the toys have moved into the home of their new owner, Bonnie. On her first day at school, Bonnie made a new Wilkins toy out of waste, which started a series of events that would include traveling with chases, getting to know new toys, meeting some of her old friends, and even a romantic story.
