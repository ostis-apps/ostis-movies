The blue fairy revived the puppet, but to become a real person, the hero must show his courage and honesty in good deeds. And so long-nosed fidget and his conscientious friend Jiminy Cricket cricket go to meet the most incredible adventures. They will meet the evil puppeteer Stromboli, look at the deceptive Island of pleasure, where naughty boys are turned into donkeys for sale, and even visit the belly of the monstrous whale that swallowed Pinocchio's father - master Gepetto.
