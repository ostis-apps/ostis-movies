Once upon a time, magic reigned in the fairy-tale world, but after the discovery of electricity, magicians were no longer needed, and development went on a technogenic path. Now elves, trolls, goblins, manticores, fairies, centaurs and unicorns fly on planes, use cars and mobile phones, and lead a generally prosaic life. The elven brothers Ian and Braly Lightfoot were raised by the same mother, because their father died when they were very young. On Ian's 16th birthday, he gets his father's staff and a magic spell that should bring him back to life for one day, but the magic crystal disappears, resurrecting only the lower half of the Pope. Brali, a big fan of quests, is incredibly happy - taking a half-pipe, the brothers go on an adventure in search of another crystal.
