12-year-old Miguel lives in a Mexican village in a family of shoemakers and secretly dreams of becoming a musician. Secretly-because in his family clan, music is considered a curse. Once, his great-grandfather left his wife, Miguel's great-grandmother, for a dream that now makes it difficult for Miguel to live in peace. Since then, the musical theme in the family has become taboo. Miguel discovers that there is some — as yet unnamed — connection between him and his favorite singer, Ernesto de La Cruz, now deceased. The boy goes to his idol in the land of the Dead, where he meets the souls of his ancestors. Coco met there with spirit, trickster by the name of Hector (in the form of a skeleton), who becomes his companion and guide. The two of them go in search of de La Cruz.
