Lightning McQueen and his friend Maitre go on an international trip â€” when McQueen gets the chance to compete for the fastest cars in the world, the World Grand Prix. Stages of these prestigious races will make friends in Tokyo, on the quays of Paris, on the coast of Italy, and on the streets of foggy London.
