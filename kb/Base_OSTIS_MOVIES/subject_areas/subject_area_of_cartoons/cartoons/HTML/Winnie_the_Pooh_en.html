When the donkey Earwig loses its tail, the owl sends friends (Winnie, Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Kanga and Baby Roo) to help the poor man find the missing, and at the same time - to save Christopher Robin from the mysterious Yaskorr. And after all, Vinnie the bear, was just going to find somewhere a little honey to eat a little, and did not even imagine that he was waiting for such a hectic day!
