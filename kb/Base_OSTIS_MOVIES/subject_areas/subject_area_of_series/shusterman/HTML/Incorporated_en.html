                      <h1>Incorporated</h1>
                        Set in a future where companies have seemingly unlimited power, Incorporated centers around Ben Larson, a young executive who risks everything to infiltrate the all-controlling corporate world and save the woman he loves. In the process, he will take on the entire system -- with deadly consequences. Ben is married to Laura, a successful plastic surgeon who's also the daughter of Ben's boss. While Ben and Laura make their home in the lush, manicured Green Zone of the well-to-do, Theo dwells in the dangerous, poverty-stricken Red Zone, and may provide a surprising connection to Ben's past. In a high-stakes world where the ethical boundaries we know have been completely redrawn, how far is Ben willing to go -- and what happens if he fails?
