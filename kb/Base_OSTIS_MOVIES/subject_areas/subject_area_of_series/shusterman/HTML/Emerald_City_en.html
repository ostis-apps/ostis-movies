                        Swept up into the eye of a tornado, 20-year-old Dorothy Gale is transported to another world - a mystical land where an all-powerful ruler governs over one kingdom, has outlawed magic, and faces not only the wrath of a growing cauldron of witches but a looming disaster brought on by a mythical force. Epic, romantic and fantastical, Emerald City is an empowering tale of a young woman finding her true strength and identity even as she battles to bring a divided world together.
