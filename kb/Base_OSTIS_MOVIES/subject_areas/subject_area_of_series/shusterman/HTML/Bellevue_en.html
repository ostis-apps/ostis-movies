                      <h1>Bellevue</h1>
                        Bellevue is a mystery set in a small blue-collar town with a lot of ‘good people' who ‘live right' and take it upon themselves to make sure the neighbours do too. Detective Annie Ryder is a cop whose intense and brazen personality has always been at odds with her hometown; so when a transgender teen goes missing, Annie dives in to unravel the disappearance that suggests foul play, despite finding herself in a difficult position as she must cast suspicion on people she has known all her life. As the case pulls her further away from her family, she is also confronted by a mysterious person from her past with disturbing answers and a terrifying need to get inside her head.
