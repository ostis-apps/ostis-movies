                      <h1>Siren</h1>
                        Siren takes us inside Bristol Cove â€“ a coastal town known for its legend of once being home to mermaids. When the arrival of a mysterious girl proves this folklore all too true, the battle between man and sea takes a very vicious turn as these predatory beings return to reclaim their right to the ocean.
