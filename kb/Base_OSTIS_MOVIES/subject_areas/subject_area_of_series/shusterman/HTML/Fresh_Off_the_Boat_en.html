                        It's the '90s and 12 year old, hip-hop loving Eddie just moved to suburban Orlando from DC's Chinatown with his parents. It's culture shock for his immigrant family in this comedy about pursuing the American Dream. Fresh Off the Boat is based on Chef Eddie Huang's memoir "Fresh Off the Boat".
