                      <h1>Devious_Maids</h1>
                        Devious Maids is set in a world where murder and mayhem collide in the mansions of Beverly Hills' wealthiest and most powerful families. Class warfare has never been as fun and dirty as it is in the tiny enclave where the staff is as clever, witty and downright devilish as their employers. The series centers on a close-knit group of maids, Marisol, Rosie, Carmen Valentina and Zoila, who are bonded together by their jobs, life struggles and the melodramatic universe that engulfs their employers.
