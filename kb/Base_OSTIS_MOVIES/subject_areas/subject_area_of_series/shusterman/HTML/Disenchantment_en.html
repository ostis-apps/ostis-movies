                      <h1>Disenchantment</h1>
                        In Disenchantment, viewers are whisked away to the crumbling medieval kingdom of Dreamland, where they follow the misadventures of hard-drinking young princess Bean, her feisty elf companion Elfo, and her personal demon Luci. Along the way, the oddball trio encounter ogres, sprites, harpies, imps, trolls, walruses, and lots of human fools.
