                      <h1>Mom</h1>
                        Christy is a single mom who, after years of questionable choices, is now sober and trying to get her life on track. She's tested daily by her newly sober mother, Bonnie, who is trying to make up for all the ways she's let Christy down. Christy is further challenged by her relationships with her own kids. Her daughter Violet is engaged to a man twice her age and her ten-year-old son, Roscoe, would rather live with his father Baxter, a former slacker who has only recently gotten himself together. To help her stay sober, Christy relies on her support system from AA, comprised of her sponsor Marjorie, her wealthy sponsee, Jill, and her emotional friend, Wendy. Christy tries to remain positive as she attempts to overcome her past and build a better future, but with her dysfunctional family and life's many setbacks, it's always an uphill battle.
