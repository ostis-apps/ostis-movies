                      <h1>Fringe</h1>
                        When an international flight lands at Boston's Logan Airport and the passengers and crew have all died grisly deaths, FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham is called in to investigate. After her partner is nearly killed during the investigation, a desperate Olivia searches frantically for someone to help, leading her to Dr. Walter Bishop, our generation's Einstein. There's only one catch: he's been institutionalized for the last twenty years, and the only way to question him requires pulling his estranged son Peter in to help. When Olivia's investigation leads her to a manipulative corporate executive, she and her team will discover that what happened on Flight 627 is only a small piece of a larger, more shocking truth and will explore the blurring line between the possible and the impossible.
