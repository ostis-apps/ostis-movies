                      <h1>Humans</h1>
                        Humans is set in a parallel present where the latest must-have gadget for any busy family is a Synth â€“ a highly-developed robotic servant eerily similar to its live counterpart. In the hope of transforming the way they live, one strained suburban family purchases a refurbished synth only to discover that sharing life with a machine has far-reaching and chilling consequences.
