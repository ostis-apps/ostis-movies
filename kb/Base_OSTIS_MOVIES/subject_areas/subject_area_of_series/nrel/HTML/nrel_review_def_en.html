<b><sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_review">Review</sc_element></b> is for those who have not watched, but possibly going. The narrator describes the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_series">series</sc_element> (or its <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_season">season</sc_element>) as a whole, without going into details and without revealing the intrigue. Basically there is a question not about a <sc_element sys_idtf="nrel_storyline">plot</sc_element>, and about quality of a product, characters, giving, advantages and lacks.
