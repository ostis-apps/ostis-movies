<h2>Appearance</h2>
Bidrill is a Pokemon that mostly resembles a two-legged yellow wasp; however, it has only four legs instead of six and no pigment fossae. Bidrill's head is round, with a slightly pointed mouth, large red eyes and a black antennae with a sharp curve in the middle. Its front legs end in long, tapered stingers. It stands on two other legs, long, segmented and insectlike in shape. Bidrill has two pairs of rounded veined wings and another stinger on a yellow-black striped belly.

Like Mega Bidrill, he takes on sharper features. Antennae are shorter and T-shaped. His eyes are getting longer and smoother. He now has three pairs of wings; the topmost pair is larger, with black trim across the top. Its stings grow longer and larger, resembling spears. Additional tapered, black and yellow blades with white tips take the place of his legs. Its abdomen becomes larger, grooved and attaches to the rib cage by a black structure. A similar black structure connects his head and chest. The sting on the abdomen is now pale yellow, and black stripes all over the body.
