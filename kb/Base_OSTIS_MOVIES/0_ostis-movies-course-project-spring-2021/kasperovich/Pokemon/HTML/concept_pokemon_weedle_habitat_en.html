<h2>Habitat</h2>
Originally from the Kanto region. It can also be found in Joto and Sinnoh. It lives in almost all forests and in other areas where tall grass grows. In such places, you need to be very careful, because the Pokemon can hide behind any leaf and bush. He himself is quite friendly, but if you disturb him, you can get hit with a poisonous thorn. Most Widrills prefer to live in colonies, protected by the beedrill. There, almost nothing threatens them, because few people want to get involved with bidrills.
