<h2>Behavior</h2>
This is a very irritable, ruthless and territorial Pokémon. Within their domain, no Pokémon or human can feel safe. The intruder will be attacked not just by one Pokemon, but by a whole swarm. The most dangerous thing is to approach their nests, it is convenient to catch vidlov and kakun there, but it is also easy to run into the stings of the Bidrills. They attack anyone who happens to be on their territory, even if he just "passed by". Also, this Pokemon is distinguished by great persistence - it will pursue the intruder to the end. When meeting a person, he behaves aggressively. There are numerous known cases of attacks on people.
