<h2>Natural ability</h2>
I saw a big pink nose and he doesn't need it for beauty. The Pok√©mon's scent is so sharp that it can determine in advance whether it has gotten a tasty leaf or not. In case of danger, the Pokemon stings the enemy or spits at him with a sticky thread. Hidden property - Run Away.
