<h2>Natural ability</h2>
In case of danger, it tries to immediately scare the predator by releasing a poisonous sting into it. If this does not help, then the Pokemon will begin to strengthen its shell and hope that either the predator will get tired of messing with it, or the beedrill will fly in and quickly force the predator to delete the kakun from its diet. Can release adhesive thread if necessary.
