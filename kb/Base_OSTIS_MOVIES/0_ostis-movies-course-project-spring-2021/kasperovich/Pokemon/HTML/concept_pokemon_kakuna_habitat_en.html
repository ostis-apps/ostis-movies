<h2>Habitat</h2>
Originally from the Kanto region. It can also be found in Joto and Sinnoh. You can find them in the forests, where they usually hide somewhere under the leaves, sticking to the branches. They also often hang on trees with their heads up, hanging on threads that they themselves weave. If you see a lot of kakuns hanging from a tree - run away from this place, for it is under the watchful guard of the bidrills.
