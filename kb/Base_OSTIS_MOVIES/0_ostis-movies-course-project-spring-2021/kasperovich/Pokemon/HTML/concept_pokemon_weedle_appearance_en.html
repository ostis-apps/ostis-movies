<h2>Appearance</h2>
Vidl looks like a brown worm. On the forehead and at the end of the tail, it has a small sting, 5 cm long. The body consists of round segments, each (except for the head) has two sucker-legs. Already by the bright color of the Pokemon, predators know in advance that it is poisonous. Pokemon's stings contain a strong poison, and if necessary, Vidl does not hesitate to use it. It constantly feeds on leaves in order to grow and evolve faster.
