<h2>Appearance</h2>
Pinsir is a large brown insect Pokemon. The head and body are united in one section, and hands grow at the level of the toothy mouth. On the head there are large horns-pincers. These pliers are very strong and at the same time very flexible, so it is impossible to break them. The pinsir's arms are long and thin, the legs are short and plump. From the cold, it becomes lethargic and at some point it simply stops moving.
