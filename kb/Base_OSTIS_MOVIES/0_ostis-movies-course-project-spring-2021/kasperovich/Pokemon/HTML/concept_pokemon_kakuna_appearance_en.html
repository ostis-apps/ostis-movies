<h2>Appearance</h2>
Kakuna is a yellow cocoon Pokemon. He has no arms or legs, only a pair of eyes betrays a living creature in the kakun. Kakuna is an intermediate stage of evolution seen in bidrilla. Vidl stores energy for a long time, constantly devouring leaves. Over time, it accumulates a sufficient supply of nutrients, and the vidl wraps itself in silk thread, becoming a kakuna. The very body of the Pokemon becomes very soft, so a hard shell-protection is vital for it. In this form, the Pokemon practically does not move: it is not able to run away or fend off predators, but it has a special ability - hardening. With its help, a Pokemon can strengthen its shell, making it almost impenetrable. From the outside, it seems that the Pokemon is not doing anything, but, in fact, under the shell, it is constantly changing, waiting for evolution. This is proved by the body temperature of the Pokemon: if you touch the shell, you immediately feel how hot it is.
