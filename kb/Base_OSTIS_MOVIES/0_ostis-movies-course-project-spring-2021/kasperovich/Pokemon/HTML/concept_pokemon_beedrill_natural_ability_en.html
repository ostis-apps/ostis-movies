<h2>Natural ability</h2>
idrill is a very dangerous opponent. The stings of the Pokemon alone are enough so that no one wants to mess with him, so Bidrill also flies perfectly and at high speed, thanks to which he can constantly sting the enemy from all sides. Bidrill's stings are not only large and sharp as a blade, they also contain a dangerous poison that is immediately injected and poisons prey. The two stingers on his forelimbs allow him to use his signature Twin Needle attack. The secret of poisonous glands on the tail of Bidrill secretes the most powerful and most dangerous poison, therefore, first of all, one must beware of the tail. Pok√©mon drag all the prey into their nests. It is believed that attacks such as a lullaby are useless against Bidrill because the Pokemon flaps its wings so quickly that the flow of air they create simply reflects sounds, preventing them from reaching Bidrill's ears.

Mega Bidrill's forelimbs produce a fast-acting poison that is used to prevent the enemy from fleeing. The tail sting produces a slow-acting poison that is used to destroy opponents.
