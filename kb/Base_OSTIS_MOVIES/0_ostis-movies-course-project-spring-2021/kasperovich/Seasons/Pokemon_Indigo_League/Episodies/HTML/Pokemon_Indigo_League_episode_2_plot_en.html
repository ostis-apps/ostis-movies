<h1>Pokemon: Indigo League Series 2</h1>
<sc_element sys_idtf = "Officer_Jenny"> Officer Jenny </sc_element> has been informed of a gang in Viridian stealing <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_type"> Pokémon </sc_element>, and she urges residents to be alert and alert to strangers. Suddenly she notices <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element></sc_element> running down the road with a wounded Pikachu in his arms. Jenny stops <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>to find out where he got this Pokemon. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>is trying to prove that this <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> is his Pokemon, but he doesn't know anything about the ID. Jenny notices Ash's Pokedex in his pocket and finds the ID in Ash's. She then decides to take <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>to the Pokémon Center. The motorbike driving away is covered with a wave of dust <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty">Misty</sc_element> , carrying a broken bike on her shoulders. Even more annoyed, she runs after them. With a fishing rod, James removes the wanted poster from the board near the post. Team R - the very gang Jenny heard about - decides to steal Pokémon from the Pokémon Center.

Jenny rides her motorcycle into the lobby of the Pokémon Center. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Sister_Joy"> Sister Joy </sc_element>, the head of the center, reminds Jenny that the vehicles are being parked. In response, she says that Pikachu needs help and <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>asks for help. Seeing Pikachu, Sister Joy gives the command to launch a stretcher for electric Pokémon and two <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_chansey">Chanseu</sc_element> bring them, Joy puts Pikachu on the stretcher and tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that everything will be fine, after which he gives Chancy the order to take Pikachu to the operating room for intensive care. Jenny introduces <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>as the new Pokémon Trainer. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>asks sister Joy what he can do for Pikachu, Joy tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that if he wants to become a good Pokemon trainer, he must be more responsible and advises against letting his Pokemon fight if they are in bad shape. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tries to explain what happened, but Joy cuts it off, saying "what's happened is gone." <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>asks what he should do, but Joy calms him down by telling him that she will take care of everything. Joy praises Jenny for quickly bringing <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>and his Pikachu, Jenny says it's her duty, and then returns to the post. Joy begins resuscitating Pikachu, while <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>remains in the waiting room.

After a few hours of waiting, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>decides to call home. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Delia_Ketchum"> Delia Ketchum </sc_element>, Ash's mom, answers the call and when she hears her son, she is immediately delighted and asks if he is all right and where he is now. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tells his mom that he is in the Pokemon Center in Viridian, Delia tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that just four days after starting his training campaign, she spoke to his father and says that he is very proud of his beloved son, because he grew up and straightened his wings like Spiro. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>sadly says that he feels like a falling Pidgey, but Delia provokes him more, saying that he must be confident in himself and then he can do whatever he plans, after which she wishes him good luck on his adventure. Right after talking to her mom, <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>notices an engraving of the legendary Pokemon. He examines it and sees a Pokemon similar to the one that flew across the rainbow. Suddenly the phone rings and <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>answers the call. This is <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> calling. <sc_element sys_idtf="Professor_Oak">Professor Oak</sc_element> tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that three other coaches from <sc_element sys_idtf="pallet_town">Alabastia</sc_element> have already made it to <sc_element sys_idtf="viridian_city">Viridian</sc_element>, and that when his grandson, Gary, said that even if <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>did get to Viridian, without a single Pokemon, the professor bet him a million dollars that Gary wrong. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tells the professor about an unusual Pokemon, but he does not believe <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that he saw the legendary Ho-oh, and then wishes <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>good luck in his adventures and runs away to pick up the pizza he ordered.

<sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> walks into the center and shows <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>her bike, which was destroyed by Thunder Shock Pikachu. She angrily tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that he will have to pay for a new bike. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tells her that his Pikachu was badly hurt and he cannot think about her bike. <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> becomes sad and after a short moment Sister Joy and the two <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_chansey">Chanseu</sc_element> bring Pikachu on a stretcher. Sister Joy, happy with the successful treatment, tells <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>that Pikachu will still need to stay at the Pokémon Center in order for him to rest and recover. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>thanks her sister Joy for her help, <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> also calms down, stating that she will give <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>time before he has to replace her bike.

Jenny reports that Team R's balloon has been spotted over the city. The ball hovers over the center of the Pokémon, and <sc_element sys_idtf="Jassy">Jassy</sc_element> and James throw the Poké Balls with Ekans and Koffing down. Both Pokémon start to make a mess. Team R enters the center and utters its motto, declaring itself. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>does not understand them, then <sc_element sys_idtf="Jassy">Jassy</sc_element> and James command their Pokémon to attack. Ash, <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element>, and Joy escape to the Poké Ball storage room. Ekans and Koffing break the wiring and the center is de-energized. Joy calms the guys down and shows them an emergency pikachu generator where a lot of pikachu generate current, then she sends pokeballs to Pewter. Team R Pokemon Burst go into the room and interfere with the transmission of Poke Balls. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tries to use Pokémon from Poké Balls, but fails. <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> then tells the R Team that she will teach them a lesson and releases Goldin. Goldin is no more useless than Ash's Pidgey and Rattata. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>tries to escape with Pikachu, but Team R catches up with him. Pikachu calls many other Pikachu, gets a charge from them, and shocks Team R with an electric shock. Meowth is not hit and goes to Pikachu to grab him. Pikachu asks <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>to help him generate even more electricity. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>starts pedaling his bike, generating energy for the headlight. Pikachu connects to the headlamp and attacks with an even more powerful electric shock. From the discharge, Koffing explodes and Team R flies into the air, and the center of the Pokémon falls apart. Joy in Viridian receives confirmation from Joy in Pewter that all the Poke Balls have been delivered safely and says that <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>and <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> have already made their way to Pewter.

<sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> screams in the Viridian Forest. She pokes with horror somewhere to the side and hides behind Ash. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>looks in the same direction and sees a Caterpie. <sc_element sys_idtf="Misty">Misty</sc_element> asks <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>to do something. <sc_element sys_idtf="Ash_Ketchum">Ash  </sc_element>removes the Poké Ball from his belt and throws it into the Caterpie.
