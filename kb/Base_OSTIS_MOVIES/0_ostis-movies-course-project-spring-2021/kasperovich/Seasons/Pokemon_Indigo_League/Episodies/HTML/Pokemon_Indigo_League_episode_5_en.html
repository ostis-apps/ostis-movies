<h1> Ep. 5: Skirmish in Pewter!  </h1>
The series begins with the appearance of the R team, which prepares another trap. They dug a hole in the road and got into it themselves. Meanwhile Ash, <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> and <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> have finally found their way out of the Viridian Forest and are heading to Pewter.

On the way, they come across a strange man who sits on the ground and sells souvenir stones - the city of Pewter is famous for them. Ash sits on one of the stones, and the stranger asks him to pay two dollars for it. The man introduces himself as Flint and offers to escort them to the center of the Pokémon, since <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> doesn't look good.

In the center, friends see Sister Joy. Ash is confused because the same sister Joy was in Viridian, but she explains to him that she is the older sister of the Joy that Ash saw. She takes away <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> to give him a break, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> points Ash to a wall ad that reads the Pokémon League Championship to take part in it, you need to get the required number of badges from the Gym Leaders in different cities of Kanto. Flint asks <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> if he dares to fight Brock, the Pewter Gym Leader and Stone Pokémon Trainer. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> says that he will go to fight because he is confident in his victory. But Flint just laughs and leaves. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> offers to help Ash because she is sure that he will lose, because the Gym Leaders are much stronger and more experienced than regular trainers. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> pompously refuses help, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> leaves.
<sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> arrives at Pewter's Gym. Brock tells Ash that he is still too weak to fight him and too inexperienced, but since he was challenged, he must accept it. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> selects <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> and Brock selects Onyx. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> is afraid to fight Onyx and wants <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> to choose another Pokemon, but <sc_telement "Ash> sc_element> is not going to change it. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> still goes into battle using an electric shock on Onyx, but since the stone type of Pokemon is invulnerable to electrical attacks, Onyx does not take damage. Onyx wraps around and squeezes <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element>. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> is forced to surrender.

Leaving the stadium with a wounded <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> in his arms, <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> sees Flint calling him to him. At Flint's home <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> says that he will never beat Brock as he is very strong, and asks why he never competed in the regional championships, since he is such a strong coach. Flint replies that there are reasons for this and escorts Ash to Brock's house. They see that Brock has ten little brothers and sisters, and he cannot leave them alone and leave the city, because they have no one else left. Their father abandoned them in hopes of becoming a Pokémon trainer, but never returned. Mother left this world.


Brock surrounded by family

Suddenly, <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> changed his mind about not being able to defeat Brock, but <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> was too low on Onyx's energy to kill. Flint promises to help him and brings him to the hydroelectric power plant. If you connect <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> to it, then his electroshock will become much stronger. But the river is dry, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> has to spin the wheel that supplies the energy himself. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element>, who came here, again offers to help him, but Ash refuses, saying that he must get the stone badge himself.

Finally, <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> charged quite strongly, although it was very difficult for him to get used to such high voltage, and the next day they went back to the stone hym. Brock agrees to a rematch, and they start fighting again. This time Brock starts with Geodud. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> chooses Pigeotto, unaware that flying Pokémon's attacks are weak against stone ones. Geodud defeats Pigeotto, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> chooses <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element>. With his enhanced electric shock, he knocks Geodud out of the battle. Brock picks Onyx, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> attacks him, throwing lightning bolts at him and nearly hitting Ash. Onyx compresses <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> again, and it reuses electricity. The punch is sensitive, but Onyx is still strong and continues to squeeze <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element>. Ash is ready to give up. But then, due to the blows <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element>, the electrical wiring lights up and the fire extinguishing system turns on. Onyx gets wet, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element>, who was watching the fight, tells Ash that the water weakens the Stone Pokémon. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> uses electroshock - and Onyx is struck down.
The fight is not over yet, but Ash is surrounded by Brock's brothers and sisters who have come from nowhere, asking him not to finish off Onyx. Ash says that the water hit Onyx by accident and he does not need such a victory, but next time he will defeat Brock in a fair fight, and leaves the gym. On the way from the city, Brock catches up with Ash, gives him a stone badge and says that after all he lost. Brock says he wants to be the world's best Pokémon breeder, not a trainer, but he can't leave town, so he wants Ash to make his dream come true.

Then Flint comes up to them and tells Brock to calmly go to his dream. He rips off his hat and false beard. It is revealed that Flint is Brock's father. Brock gives his father the necessary instructions for raising a family, and sets out with Ash on an adventure. And <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> continues to follow them, saying that she will continue to chase them until Ash gives her the money for the broken bike. Ash and Brock run away from <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element>, stepping on Jesse, James and Meowth, who have just emerged from their pit, who fall into it again.
