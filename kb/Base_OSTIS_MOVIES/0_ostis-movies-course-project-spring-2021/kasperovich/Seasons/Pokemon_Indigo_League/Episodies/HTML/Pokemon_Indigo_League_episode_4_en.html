<h1> Ep. 4: The Samurai Challenges! </h1>
The series begins by repeating the events of the last three episodes. Then the <sc_element sys_idtf = "Viridian_Forest"> Viridian Forest </sc_element> is shown again, in which <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> is screaming. Misty claims that she saw another beetle, to which Ash changes into a cow costume and makes fun of her, from which she falls from the tree.

After that, Ash notices <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_weedle"> Weedle </sc_element> and is about to catch him. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> tries to dissuade him, but <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> stands his ground. He wants to release Pikachu, but immediately discovers that the latter is resting, which is why <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> (along with <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element>) is very surprised. Then <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> decides to release someone else, but Misty discovers that Vidl is rubbing against her leg, which makes her scared and runs away, throwing off <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_weedle"> Weedle </sc_element>  to the ground. Ash releases Pigeotto and orders him to attack Vidl with the wind. At the same time, Misty walks through the forest, arguing out loud that the forest is full of various nasty Pokémon. But she is attacked by a Samurai, who holds a sword to her head, asking if she is the trainer from <sc_element sys_idtf = "pallet_town"> Alabastia </sc_element>. Misty replies that it is not her, after which the Samurai leaves, and Misty realizes that the trainer he is looking for is Ash. At the same time, Widdle attacks Pigeotto, but the latter evades the attack and continues to attack him with the wind.

Ash decides it's time to catch <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_weedle"> Weedle </sc_element>  and wants to throw his pokeball, but a Samurai comes up from behind, asking if he is a trainer from Pallet Town. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> replies that it is him, after which the Samurai swings his katana at him, bringing it to Ash's face. He challenges Ash to a fight, after which Ash is annoyed to find that Widle has escaped.

The duel begins. The samurai releases the <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pinsir"> Pinsira </sc_element>, Ash releases the tired Pigeotto. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pidgeotto"> Pigeotto </sc_element> causes a hurricane, but <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pinsir"> Pokemon </sc_element> attacks him with his pincers, knocking him out. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> releases the Metapod. The metapod uses the fortification, and then withstands the attack of <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pinsir"> Pinsir </sc_element>, breaking its pincers. The samurai recalls him and releases his Metapod. He also uses fortification, after which both Pokémon stand for a long time and do nothing.


Roy Beadrill

Meanwhile, Team R, in their paper "hideout", crosses the forest. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> and the Samurai stand until they see the swarm of Bidrill. They stop their fight, starting to run away, after which they hide, but find a tree next to them, on which Kakuns are; some of them evolve into Beedrill and steal <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash's Metapod </sc_element>.

<sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element>, <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> and Samurai run to Samurai's house, after which the latter blames Ash for the fact that the Metapod was stolen due to his inexperience ... Then he talks about losing to three coaches from Pallet Town. Everyone goes to bed, and in the morning <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> goes to rescue <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_metapod"> Metapod </sc_element>, but meets the R team, who say their trademark greeting, thereby waking up Bidrill. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> immediately bursts forward and dashes past the flying Bedrill. Team R hopes to defend themselves with their "hideout", but discovers that it has been nibbled by Widla, and then retreats.
<sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> tries to save the Metapod by saying that he should enter the Poké Ball, but he refuses. Then Ash takes him in his arms and runs, but soon stumbles and drops him to the ground, he vows that he will never leave his friends. Bidrilla flies at him; <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_metapod"> Metapod </sc_element> protects Ash and then evolves into Butterfly. But a whole swarm of Bidrill is already flying at them, but Butterfree puts them to sleep along with the R team.

The samurai and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> say goodbye, but want to meet again to fight. The R command gets stuck in a tree. This is where the series ends.
