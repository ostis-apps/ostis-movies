<h1> Ep. 6: Clefairie and the moonstone </h1>
The path of Ash, Misty, <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> and their new friend and companion Brock lies to the mysterious Moon Mountain, about which many different legends and stories have long been told. One of the legends says that in ancient times a huge meteorite crashed into the mountain, which was later called the Moonstone. Approaching the mountain, the friends saw a man lying on the ground, who was attacked by a whole flock of wolves. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> used Thunder Shock, and the teeth flew deeper into the cavern that led into the mountain. The man is very glad that they saved him, he introduces himself as the scientist Seymour.

They enter the cave, and Seymour reveals that someone has hung lamps in the cave that scare the Pokémon in need of darkness. He also says that he is in the mountain to protect it from vandals who are attacking the cave in search of the moonstone. From his story, it is clear why various robbers are trying to seize this stone. Scientists have studied various fragments of the stone and realized that it gives tremendous power to Pokémon, so everyone is so eager to find it. Seymour puts forward the theory that the Pokémon came from space, and the moonstone is their spaceship. But then a Pokemon running past distracts them from the conversation. It turns out to be a clefairie. Pokedex says that this Pokemon lives inside the moon mountain and very rarely goes outside. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> tries to catch him but is stopped by Seymour.

Suddenly, the Clefairies are attacked by the suddenly appeared R team, which wants to get the moonstone so that their Pokémon become the strongest. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> and Brock decide to stop them. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> chooses Butterfree, and Brock chooses Zubat, whom he found he caught in front of the cave. Team R fills Coffing and Ekans. Coffing uses a smokescreen, but Butterfree and Zubat disperse the smoke with aerial attacks, and Coffing's smoke hits Team R. Meanwhile, Ekans bites Butterfree and Coffing hits Zubat with his whole body. Suddenly, Zubat attacks with ultrasound, and Koffing and Ekans, who have lost their composure, become entangled with each other. Butterfly ends the fight with an air attack, and Team R, along with their Pokémon, flies into the depths of the cave.

But then it turned out that Meowth had disappeared, who managed to escape during the battle and is now trying to catch the fleeing Clefeiri. Clefeiry falls down the mountain and on the way knocks the climbers up <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> and Seymour. Fortunately, they fall into the water, and water is known to be the element of <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> and her Pokémon. <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> summons Staru, who first knocks Meowth down with a Starfall jumping towards them, and then finishes him off with a Water Cannon, and Meowth flew off to catch up with Jesse and James who had flown away earlier.

Brock, meanwhile, feeds the Pokémon made from a special recipe, and <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> talks to Clefeiri. Suddenly they take off and run away somewhere. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> and Clefairi lead friends to the cave entrance, hidden behind some bushes. Coming out of the cave, they see a huge moonstone lying inside the mountain: the legends did not lie and the stone really exists. Clefairie walks up to him and places a small moonstone fragment next to the rest of the small rocks around the larger one. This was the last missing piece. The stone glows with a bright blue light, and a whole bunch of clefairies are coming up to it. They start to do something very similar to a dance and jump around the stone. <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_pokemon_pikachu"> Pikachu </sc_element> explained in gestures that they are praying to the moonstone this way.

And suddenly Team R reappears, they release their Pokémon. Coffing with a smoke attack distracts friends with their Pokémon, and when the smoke clears, they see that the moonstone has disappeared. Onyx chases Team R, who slides on a rock down the side of the mountain and, emerging from the ground, collides with them. Ash, Brock and <sc_element sys_idtf = "Misty"> Misty </sc_element> arrive to see Seymour and Clefairie crawling out of the ground and launching a group attack with a metronome. This attack caused an explosion of enormous force, and the R team flew back to hell.

From the explosion, the moonstone split into many small fragments, which, falling down, fell on the clefairies, and they began to evolve. As a result, half of the Clefairies successfully evolved into Clefables.

At the end of the episode, Seymour told his friends that he decided to stay on Moon Mountain with the Clefairies and someday they would fly into space together. The friends said goodbye to Seymour and the Clefairies and continued on their way. They came to a fork in the road with a sign indicating the direction to the city of Cerulin. The sign read: "Gary was here, and <sc_element sys_idtf =" Ash_Ketchum "> Ash </sc_element> is a loser." <sc_element sys_idtf = "Ash_Ketchum"> Ash </sc_element> is enraged and, headlong, runs towards Cerulin to take revenge on his abuser - Gary.
