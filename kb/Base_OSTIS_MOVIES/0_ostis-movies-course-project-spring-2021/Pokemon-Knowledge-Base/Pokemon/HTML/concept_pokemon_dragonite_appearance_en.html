<h2>Appearance</h2>
Unlike its pre-evolutions, Dragonite has limbs. In all its appearance, it resembles dragons from the myths of the Middle Ages. Despite the fact that it decreases after evolution, Dragonite is still larger than a person. With small wings and a large body, Dragonite can fly faster than the speed of sound.
