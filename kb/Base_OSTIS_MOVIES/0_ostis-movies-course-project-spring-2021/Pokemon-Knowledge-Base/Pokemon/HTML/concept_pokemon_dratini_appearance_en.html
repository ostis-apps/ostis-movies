<h2>Appearance</h2>
Dratini is a small <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element> that looks like a snake. Its head and back are light blue, and the muzzle and abdomen are grayish. The dratini has shell-like fins on the head, and a gray dot in the middle of the forehead. The eyes are large, oval, purple. Already at birth, the dratini is rather big, and over time it grows even more and becomes much longer. To do this, he sheds his old skin. At the moment of molting, the dratini becomes very vulnerable, therefore, before molting, he tries to hide somewhere, for example, behind a large waterfall. They say that molting occurs due to the fact that the body of the dratini is full of vital energy, which constantly renews the body of the <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon">pokemon</sc_element>.
