<h2>Appearance</h2>
It is similar to <sc_element sys_idtf="concept_pokemon_cubone">cubone</sc_element>, only larger in size. He is also light brown in color, wears a skull on his head and holds a bone in his hand. However, there are also differences. For example, the shape of the skull has changed slightly. If Cubone's mother's skull looked more like a dinosaur's skull, then Marowak's - like a wolf or a fox. The skull also seemed to merge with the head. In addition to the skull, the bone also changed size. Marowak has a tail, but a thorn is located, and he also has stripes on his stomach.
