<h2>Appearance</h2>
The growth of the Pokemon is small enough. He has a light brown color, outwardly somewhat similar to a dinosaur. Cubone does not show his face because he is wearing his mother's skull. People have been puzzling over why he does this and what kind of face he has. There is a theory that his head is soft and he needs to protect it, and where can you find a knight's helmet made of iron in nature? In addition to the skull, Cubone carries a bone with him and uses it as a weapon.
