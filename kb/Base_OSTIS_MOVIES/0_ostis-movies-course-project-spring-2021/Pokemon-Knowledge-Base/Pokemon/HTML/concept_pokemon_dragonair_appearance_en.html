<h2>Appearance</h2>
Dragonair's appearance is similar to sea serpents with long, sleek bodies. The upper part of its body is light blue and the lower part is white. It has a small white horn on its forehead and two wing-like projections on the sides of its head, which are often called ears, but are actually wings, as evidenced in the short film that preceded Pokemon: Movie 2. It has a blue sphere located on the neck, and two more near the tip of the tail. Along with Dratini, his mouth is rarely seen. It is not known if he has a mouth. Shiney's Pok√©mon version of Dragonair has lavender-pink skin on the upper body rather than light blue.
