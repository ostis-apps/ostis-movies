<h2>Behavior</h2>
Dragonite is a very useful, and most importantly, kind and compassionate Pokemon. He rescues sailors from trouble. If not for Dragonite, many sailors would have drowned! But if you seriously anger Dragonite, and no one can stop him: he will destroy everything that stands in his way, although later, most likely, he will very much regret it.
