<h2>Behavior</h2>
Sandshrew is a pretty calm and kind Pokemon. He rarely attacks first and prefers to defend himself. In case of danger, he will blind the enemy with sand in the eyes, curl up into a ball and roll away. He can only attack while hunting. But a skilled trainer is able to re-educate his Pokemon, Sandshrew can become very brave in battle, even learn to swim, despite the fear of water.
