<h2>Habitat</h2>
Sandshrew is from Kanto. They live in arid, waterless places. Mostly in deserts and steppes. They can sometimes be found in the upper levels of the caves. Sandshrews are afraid of water, so they rarely drink and do not like to approach water bodies. They live underground, for this they themselves dig holes for themselves with powerful paws. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkled. It dries up using geothermal heat near the volcano.

The Alolian form is found only on Alola and lives in the snowy mountains.
