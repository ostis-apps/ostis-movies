<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The full name of the heroine is Cyril Fiona Helen Rhiannon. It also bears the nickname Lion of Cintra. The name of the heroine in the Elder Speech sounds like "Zirael", which means "swallow". The Witcher saga has its own chronology, according to which Ciri was born in May 1252. Ciri becomes the object of interest of many influential people, each of whom has their own plans for the girl. The Nilfgaardian emperor, the Lodge of sorceresses and the sorcerer Vilgefortz are trying to "lay hands on" the heroine. The reason for this interest is the prediction that the descendant of Ciri will influence the fate of the world.</span></p>
