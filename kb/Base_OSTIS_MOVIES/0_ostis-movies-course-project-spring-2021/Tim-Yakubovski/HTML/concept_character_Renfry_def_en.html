<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Renfri is the daughter of Prince Craiden Fredefalk from his first marriage, the stepdaughter of Aridea. The latter learned through a magic mirror that Renfri would be the cause of her death, and reported this to the sorcerers. The wizard Stregobor came to the conclusion that the princess is a mutant. Then it was decided to kill her, but Renfrey was saved. After that, she began a wandering life, and a few years later she headed a robber gang, which included seven dwarves. Now she was known under the nickname Shrike, and she was famous for her cruelty and skillful handling of weapons. By the age of 17, Renfrey had the entire Mahakam in awe. In Blaviken, she met Herold, who killed her in a duel in the market square.</span></p>
