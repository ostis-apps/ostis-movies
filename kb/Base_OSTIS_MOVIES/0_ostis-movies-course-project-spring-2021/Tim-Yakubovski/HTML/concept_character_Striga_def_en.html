<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An extremely vicious female creature that harbors a strong hatred of almost all living things. What little information we have about her is mainly transmitted by survivors of the attacks and witchers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Legend has it that Strygs only hunt when the moon is full, but during this process they are blinded by hatred and attack without hesitation. At the same time, they are very picky eaters: they use their long, sharp claws to kill or injure prey, but never completely devour it. They approach the matter selectively, eating only those organs that they want to eat at that moment. Stryga's most famous story is that of Temeria, with Princess Adda.</span></p>
