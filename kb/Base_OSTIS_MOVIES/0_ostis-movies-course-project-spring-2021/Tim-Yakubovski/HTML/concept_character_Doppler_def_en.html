<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their original form, Dopplers look rather unattractive - thin white skin, bluish veins and bloodshot eyes. Their shapes appear blurry, as if in reference to their ability to change shape. Doppler can only take forms similar to its own. He copies not only the appearance of a person, but also his voice, way of thinking and behavior. If you suddenly pissed off Doppler, just use any silver object to fight back.</span></p>
