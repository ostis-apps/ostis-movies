<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emgyr var Emreis is the son of Emperor Fergus var Emreis. His father was overthrown, and Emhyr was able to flee, but he was bewitched: every day he turned into a monstrous hedgehog and only at night did he become a man again. He settled in Erlenwald under the name Jozh. Emgyr managed to save the king of Cintra Rögner, and he promised him in gratitude "what he left at home, but what he does not know about." It was later revealed that this is Rögner's newborn daughter Pavetta; 15 years later, Jozh received this princess as his wife, after which the spell broke and he stopped turning into a monster.</span></p>
