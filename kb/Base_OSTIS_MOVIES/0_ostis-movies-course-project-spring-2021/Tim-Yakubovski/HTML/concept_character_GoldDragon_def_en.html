<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A mythical serpent-like creature from the draconian family. Not to be confused with white, black, red, green, or stone dragons. There are travelers who claim to have seen the glittering golden scales of the beast in the Korat Desert, but there is no guarantee that this was not a hallucination caused by dehydration.An alternative observation was recorded in 1262. A group of dragon hunters, including the dwarf Yarpen Zigrin, the witcher Geralt of Rivia, and the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, returned from the Caingorn Mountains claiming they had seen the golden dragon. According to their stories, the golden dragon mastered the art of polymorphism - initially, he traveled with their group under the guise of a man named Borh Tri Galki. In the guise of a dragon, he bore the hard-to-pronounce name Villentretenmert.</span></p>
