It boasts a thriving economy and a powerful, well-trained army led by talented commanders. The inhabitants of the empire outside of it are called Nilfgaardians (or Nilfs) or blacks, but inside the empire, Nilfgaardians are usually called only the inhabitants of the historical core of the state.</span></p>
