<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As ancient as Brokilon himself, the lord of the Dryads, who does not leave her abode in Duen Canell. She does not recognize everything that relates to people, and is dismissive of the kingdoms located near the borders of her forest. In her entire life, she gave birth to only one daughter named Morinne, who died defending the forest. Good for Geralt.</span></p>
