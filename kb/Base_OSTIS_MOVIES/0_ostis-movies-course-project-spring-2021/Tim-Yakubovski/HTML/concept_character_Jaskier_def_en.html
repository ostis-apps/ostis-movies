<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buttercup, aka Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhof - a wandering bard. Best friend and constant companion of Geralt of Rivia. Buttercup is the author of numerous ballads and poems. In many of his works, he tells about the adventures of Geralt, thanks to which the witcher is quite famous, in fact, being the most famous witcher of the North. More or less fully, readers become aware of only excerpts from the memoirs "Half a Century of Poetry", which Dandelion began to write after Geralt's desertion from the Riva army. Obviously, these memoirs are one of the few literary monuments of the northerners that survived the ice age.</span></p>
