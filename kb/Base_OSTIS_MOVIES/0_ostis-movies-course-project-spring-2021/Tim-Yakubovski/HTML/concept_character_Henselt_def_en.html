<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Henselt is a large, broad-shouldered aging man, who, however, has not yet lost his strength and become. He has a wide face, a large nose, small dark eyes, a thick dark blond beard and short hair on his head. He prefers rich red and burgundy robes with gold embroidery and fur trim, and wears unicorn jewelry and coats of arms. For war, he wears some parts of plate armor, and even wears a crown in battle.</span></p>
