<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yennefer was born in Vengerberg, the capital of the Kingdom of Aedirn, in Beltane in 1173. Yennefer was born a hunchback, most likely this was due to the fact that Yennefer was a Quarteron, there were elves in her mother's line, including elven sorceresses. Her parents sent the girl to the school of sorceresses in Arethusa for education and training in magic, as they did not see the opportunity to marry her due to ugliness. The enchantress Tissaya de Vries refused to be her mentor. But after attempting Yennefer's suicide, the archmagister took her as a student and corrected the defects in her appearance.Yennefer took part in the Battle of Sodden Hill. She met Geralt in Rinda when he was looking for a way to save Dandelion from the consequences of meeting a genie. This meeting was the beginning of their love.</span></p>
