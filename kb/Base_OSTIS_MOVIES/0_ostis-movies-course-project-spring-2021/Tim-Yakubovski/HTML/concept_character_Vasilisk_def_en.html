<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Basilisks are strange, scaled, lizard-like creatures belonging to the Draconid class. They have a long lizard tail, a curved bird beak, and four limbs: webbed wings that allow them to fly, and hind legs. The most dangerous weapons of these creatures are not even sickle claws or a sharp beak, but a deadly poison - the strongest known neurotoxin that kills a person in one second. The color of the scales is usually green, turning yellowish on the belly. There are various individuals, like slightly exceeding the size of the kurolisks, with which the basilisks are often confused, to huge creatures with a wingspan of large donkeys or small dragons.</span></p>
