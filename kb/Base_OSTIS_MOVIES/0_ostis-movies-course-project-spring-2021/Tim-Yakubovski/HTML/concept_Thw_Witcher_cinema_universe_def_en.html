<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The main character of the series is Geralt from Rivia, a witch - a hired man, fulfilling orders related to the destruction of beasts, which pose a threat to people's lives. As a child, he, like other witches, was subjected to mutations, because of which he acquired superhuman fighting qualities: increased strength, lightning-fast reflexes, accelerated metabolism, immunity to poisons, but at the same time lost the opportunity to have children.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Geralt's main job is to destroy dangerous monsters for money. However, he is not always ready to mindlessly fulfill the orders of his employers. For example, it refuses to destroy sentient beings, or dragons, that are threatened with extinction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In accordance with his own code of conduct, he tries not to participate in the political intrigues of kings and sorcerers, but eventually finds himself involved in a complex knot of confrontation between the northern kingdoms and the powerful southern empire of Nilfgaard. Geralt tries to protect his adopted daughter and the young princess of the ruined kingdom of Cintra Ciri, intended for him before she was born. Ciri becomes the center of the interests of influential forces, as her descendant is predicted to decide the fate of the world. Having received from his foster parents symbolic gifts-skills: witch -- to wield a sword; and the sorcerer's magic; having suffered a difficult ordeal in the future, Ciri becomes along with Geralt the main character of the series.</span></p>
