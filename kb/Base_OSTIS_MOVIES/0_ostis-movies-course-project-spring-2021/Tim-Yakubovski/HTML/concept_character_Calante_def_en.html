<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calanthe was born in 1217 to the Cintrian royal family, in the marriage of Adalia and Dagorad. Gossip circulated around the princess that she was the fruit of incest, although genealogically and not entirely obvious. Adaliya's grandfather Amavet and Dagorada's grandmother Fiona were relatives, namely, blood brothers and sisters. Subsequently, rumors about this will significantly affect the fate of the young princess.As the only child in the family, besides a girl, all that Calante could count on, according to the traditions of Cintra, is a monarchical marriage, in which she was given the role of only a shadow with her husband-king. And undoubtedly it would have been, if not for the power-hungry character of Calanthe. After the death of her parents, she begins to oppose the aristocracy, wanting to become the sole ruler of Cintra, just for formality keeping the prince-consort next to her.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The irrepressible ambitions of the princess, faced with the traditions and protest of aristocratic families, threatened to result in a civil war ... But the nobles unexpectedly offer another path beneficial to both sides, namely, marriage with RÃ¶gner, Prince of Ebbing.</span></p>
