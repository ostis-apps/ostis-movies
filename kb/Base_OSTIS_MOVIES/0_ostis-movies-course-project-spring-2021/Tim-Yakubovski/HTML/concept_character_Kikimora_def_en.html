<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The appearance of the kikimora is a controversial thing. Indeed, the story does not say directly that the kikimora looks like a spider, or something else, so there is a version that the kikimora should actually look like this: the growth of an average person, a one-eyed, scaly creature that lives in swamps and wet lowlands near rivers.Kikimora is also referred to as "stabbing". The skin is black, there is a goiter on the neck, due to which the creature makes frightening sounds. It attacks in a jump, tearing the throat and body of the victim with its fangs. The elongated jaws are overly strong and can easily break the opponent's cervical vertebrae. Saliva and cutaneous mucus are poisonous and cause rashes and irritation. It is especially dangerous in the spring, since the kikimora, hungry after winter, comes close to the villages. He skillfully hides in the swamps from his victims and attacks only at the last moment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's hard to believe that these arachnid creatures have so few fans willing to observe and study them. Perhaps this is because researchers and insect collectors rarely return from expeditions to the kikimore colonies, and thus never disseminate their conclusions about these magnificent creatures.</span></p>
