<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cahir Maur Dyffin aep Keallah is a young Nilfgaardian knight. Noble lord, brave, valiant, sincere. He found himself in a difficult situation, but at the same time he retains his face. Cahir is a knight in every sense and tries to act as his conscience demands. This makes him related to Geralt, who also has his own code of honor. Perhaps this is partly why they ended up fighting shoulder to shoulder, although initially they were on opposite sides.</span></p>
