<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the third episode of The Witcher, it becomes clear to the viewer that the plot lines in the series do not overlap in time. Yennefer's line takes place in time before the stories of Geralt and Ciri. The time difference is about two decades - at the time of Yennefer's training, Nilfgaard was still considered a small southern kingdom, to which large states did not pay much attention, while Cintra was the most powerful kingdom.</span></p>
