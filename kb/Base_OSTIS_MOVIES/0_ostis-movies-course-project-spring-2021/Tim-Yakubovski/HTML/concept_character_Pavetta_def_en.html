<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pavetta's mother, Queen Calanthe, wished to marry her fifteen-year-old daughter to Crach an Craite, nephew of Bran, Jarl of the Skellige Islands, since Cintra needed an alliance with the islanders.At a festive dinner, where the knights arrived in order to ask for the hand and bed of Pavetta, a certain Jozh tries to interfere with Calanthe's plans, saying that according to the oath taken by King RÃ¶gner, Pavetta belongs to him by the Right of Surprise. Geralt, present at the festival, explains that the Child-Surprise, Pavetta, must go with Yozh of his own free will, thereby confirming his Destiny. Despite the protests of his mother and the monstrous appearance of Joz, in which he appears before everyone, Pavetta voluntarily agrees to leave with him.</span></p>
