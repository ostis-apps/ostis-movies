<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Emperor of Nilfgaard or simply the Emperor (in the Niflgaard dialect - Ker'zaer) is the title of the ruler of the Nilfgaard Empire, inherited. The holder of this title has unlimited power. He connects political power with religious - the emperor is the high priest of the Great Sun, that is, the head of the cult dominating in the Empire. The Nilfgaard Senate has no influence on him. The Emperor's brigade is responsible for the personal safety of the emperor, numbering about 5,000 soldiers fanatically loyal to the emperor.</span></p>
