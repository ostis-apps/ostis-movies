Candyman has the appearance of a thin and very long African American, six feet five inches, taller than all the characters in the films. He wears a large brown fur coat, gray trousers, a pair of polished leather boots, has a tie around his neck, and also has a bloody hook on his right hand, which he uses to maim victims. The cloak is used to hide the injuries he received shortly before his death. Beneath it lies Candyman's chest and hollowed out belly, as well as his internal organs, to which the bees living inside him are stuck. His hair is black and curly, but very short.
