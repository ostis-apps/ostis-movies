Angelique was originally a princess of the Labyrinth before becoming a cenobite. Summoned to the mortal realm, she possessed a young woman's corpse following a sacrificial summoning ceremony. For the next few centuries, she would fight to destroy the bloodline of Phillipe Le' Merchant (Philip LeMarchand), whose descendant had found a way to destroy the powers he's unleashed with the Lament Configuration by sealing the mortal realm off from Hell by enacting his plans for the Elysium Configuration. During this time Angelique eventually summoned Pinhead for help, but quickly realized (by his grotesque physical appearance) that Hell wasn't as she one remembered it.
