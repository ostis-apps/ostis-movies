Horrible executioner, right-hand man of Pinhead, favorite of Leviathan. Child of suffering, born blind and crippled. With the help of Lemarshan's Box, he sought relief from his torment, but found only the indulgence of pain. His loneliness and suffering are always accompanied by the echo of the sound of his clicking teeth. Distinctive features: due to terrible burns, it has a shapeless, earless, noseless and eyeless face with hooks pulling the lips to the sides, because of which constantly clicking jaws are clearly visible. Sutured incisions are visible through the cuts in the robe on the chest and abdomen.
