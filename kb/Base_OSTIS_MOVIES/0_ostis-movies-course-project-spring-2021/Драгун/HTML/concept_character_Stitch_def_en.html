cenobite woman. The daughter of an 18th century French priest, Gabrielle. Filled with a thirst for sin and not finding comfort in the pages of her father's Bible, she turned to the dark arts, for which she was sentenced to be burned as a witch. Her salvation - an engraved box - was bestowed on her by a stranger the night before her execution. Distinctive features: gray wrinkled flesh, the skin on the hairless head is cut, pulled and sewn again, forming a kind of grotesque mask with slit-eyes. She wears a belt of guts, possibly her own.
