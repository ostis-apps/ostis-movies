Like most of the Nightbreed, there is little information about the mysterious woman known as Shuna Sassi. Like the rest of her race, Shuna Sassi was once human, but was reborn as a member of the Nightbreed following a violent death. She lived in the mysterious community known as Midian - a subterranean necropolis beneath a cemetery located in the town of Shere Neck, Alberta, Canada.

Shuna Sassi's body was coated with fine, needle-sharp quills, which she could project outward to defend herself from oncoming attackers. This proved vital when a group of police officers, led by the driven Captain Eigerman raided Midian and began exterminating as many of the Nightbreed as they could find. Shuna Sassi survived the assault, due in large measure to Midian's newest savior, Aaron Boone. Following the destruction of Midian, Boone led the Nightbreed on a journey to find a new haven where they could live in peace.
