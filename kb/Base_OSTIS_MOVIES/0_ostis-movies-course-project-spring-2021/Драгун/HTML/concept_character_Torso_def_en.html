perhaps the most brutally changed person in the history of the Senobite surgical practice, constantly seeking new ways to inflict endless pain and suffering. Demonstrating the sadistic nature of its creator, Torso wanders the hellish corridors of the dark Labyrinth in search of its owner - Chatterer. Distinctive features: moves on hands, due to the absence of the lower body, starting from the navel. Whitish, covered, like Wire Twins, with scorched symbols. The head is actually a mirror image of the Chatterer. Like his master, he is blind and constantly clicks his jaws, his lips are widely stretched in all directions with steel threads.
