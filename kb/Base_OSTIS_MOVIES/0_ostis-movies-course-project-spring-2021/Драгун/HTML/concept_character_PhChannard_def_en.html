The Doctor was a malevolent Cenobite that served as a willing servant of Leviathan, the lord of Hell. As a human, Dr. Philip Channard was a co-founder of the famed Channard Institute. He spent a lifetime trying to unlock damaged minds when in truth his own mind was the most damaged of all. He became obsessed with his collection and documentation of The Puzzle Boxes that had such history attached to them. Using the wisdom he gained, Phillip used a mental patient to manipulate the box atop of the mattress that Julia was murdered to bring her back to life. The doctor continues to feed Julia until she is regenerated.
