A young man named Boone finds himself guilty of a series of brutal murders. Psychiatrist Decker convinced him of this. Boone seeks salvation in the legendary Midian, an underground city of fugitives where all sins are forgiven. This city serves as a refuge for the people of the night - an ancient race of monstrous mutants that change their appearance and hide from daylight and human eyes. Warmly greeted by the people of the night, Bun should henceforth put the safety of Midian above all else. And forever forget Laurie, who loves him and is trying to find him. And in her footsteps are the police and Decker, who dreams of destroying the people of the night.
