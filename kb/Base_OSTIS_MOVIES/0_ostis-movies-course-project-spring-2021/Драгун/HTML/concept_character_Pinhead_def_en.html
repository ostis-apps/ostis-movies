Pinhead - Engineer, Dark Prince of Pain, Angel of Suffering, Black Priest of Hell, Lord of the Damned Leviathan. Head of the Cenobites. During the First World War, the captain of the British troops, Elliot Spencer, saw many atrocities that destroyed his faith in humanity. To numb his pain, he descended into debauchery and debauchery. Through the Lament Configuration that came to him in India, the forbidden world of pain and pleasure, inaccessible to mankind, was opened to him; and in the end this world became his fiefdom. Distinctive features: his entire pale, hairless head is covered with longitudinal and transverse cuts, in the intersection of which pins are driven. A hook is stuck into the navel, and a kind of symmetrical collage is formed on the chest of pieces of this flesh attached to the robe, and wounds formed at the sites of the carved flesh. Able to control chains from a distance with hooks attached to them.
