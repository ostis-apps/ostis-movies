Leviathan's Sisters of Tormented Pleasures. Two beautiful twins trapped in the dark world of the Labyrinth. Now their eternity is wasted in nursing sharing in the torment of the flesh of their victims. Distinctive features: there is no skin on the belly of their bloodless bodies covered with black latex, their chins are connected to the upper part of their breasts with steel threads. Black lips stand out on the noseless face, behind which is hidden an inhumanly long black tongue. The eyelids are sewn together, and the entire body and head are covered with scorched symbols. A single strand of hair sticks out of an iron structure hammered into the crown of the head.
