twin brothers Mark and Michael Norrington worked as security guards in the building of Merchan, a descendant of Lemarshan. During a routine round, they ended up in the lair of Pinhead, who guaranteed the brothers that they would always be together by combining them into one cenobite. Distinctive features: they have a common torso, united of two, sewn in the middle, and two heads, tied together with the help of skin from their cheeks. The skin on their faces is stretched in such a way that one twin is constantly smiling, while the other always has a sad expression. This cenobite attacks, first dividing into two independent creatures, and then, when the victim is between them, connecting and absorbing the victim.
