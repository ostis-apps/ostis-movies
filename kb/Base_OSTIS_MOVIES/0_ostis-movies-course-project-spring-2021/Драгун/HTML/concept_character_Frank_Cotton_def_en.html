Frank Cotton was the brother of Larry Cotton, the uncle of Kirsty Cotton and the brother-in-law/lover of Julia Cotton. He came into the possession of the Lament Configuration, which ultimately led to him being tortured by the Cenobites. He was later revived and helped by Julia to restore himself to human form. He was eventually recaptured by the Cenobites and sent back to Hell.
