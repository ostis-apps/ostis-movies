Bound is a female cenobite that appeared in Hellraiser: Hellseeker. After Hellseeker, Bound was replaced by her male counterpart Bound II in Hellraiser: Deader and Hellraiser: Hellworld, making her a cenobite with one of the most minor roles in the Hellraiser series. Her fellow Gash member, Surgeon is the same way.
