    The director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DoP) is in charge of the look of the "frame" of the movie shots, hence the name "photography". They are the chief of the camera and lighting crew of the film. The DP makes decisions on lighting and framing of shots in conjunction with the film's director. Typically, the director tells the DP how they want a shot to look, and the DP chooses the correct lens, filter, lighting and composition to achieve the desired aesthetic effect. The DP is the senior creative crew member after the director.
